\title{Project Management Plan}

%A Project Management Plan should be submitted as a supplementary document, and may be up to 
%15 pages in length, although many programs will not need this much space. (Note that the solicitation 
%stated that the management plan should be provided in the Project Description; here we move it to its 
%own supplementary document so that it may be explicitly evaluated by reviewers.)  This section must 
%present a clear and thorough discussion of the project management structure and techniques that will 
%be applied. It may include, for example, a construction plan and schedule, a collaboration management 
%plan, a plan for managing telescope access, or any other pertinent management information. The 
%management plan should identify risks and describe their planned mitigation. If your proposed project 
%would have contributions from sources other than NSF, this section should clearly state both the total 
%cost, and the amount being requested from NSF.  

HERA builds upon the organization, tools and linkages developed within the PAPER and MWA collaborations.
In addition to the funded collaborators in the {\em List of Partner Institutions},
HERA includes key partners in South Africa and the UK and is finalizing the collaboration with ASIAA.
