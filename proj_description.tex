\section{Overview of this Proposal} % 1 page ~ project summary? 

% XXX
% I would really start out saying that this is a proposal to detect the EOR 21 cm
% at high enough significance to exclude models based on scale and redshift
% dependence of the power spectrum, plus map the brightest features.  The array
% itself is a consequence, not the driver, of the proposal.

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) roadmap is a staged
plan to use the unique properties of the 21~cm ``spin-flip" line from neutral
hydrogen to probe our cosmic dawn, from the birth of the first 
stars and black holes through the full reionization of the primordial
intergalactic medium (IGM). During this epoch, roughly 0.1--1~Gyr after the Big Bang, 
the neutral hydrogen that pervades the Universe 
following recombination is warmed, and then reionized by the first luminous sources. 
The Universe is transformed from one dominated by simple,
linear evolution driven by gravity to an extraordinarily complex system with stars, black holes, and galaxies that
change dramatically the state of baryons in the Universe through widespread heating and reionization.
Direct observation of the large-scale structure of the primordial
IGM, and its evolution with time, via the \HI 21~cm line will
have a profound impact on our understanding of the birth of the first
galaxies and black holes, their influence on the surrounding gas,
and cosmology. 

HERA was ranked the ``{\it top priority in the Radio, Millimeter, and
Sub-millimeter category of recommended new facilities for mid-scale
funding}" as part of the {\it New Worlds, New Horizons of Astronomy
and Astrophysics} decadal survey (\citealt{astro2010}; hereafter
NWNH).  The HERA roadmap initially envisioned a series of radio
interferometers constructed throughout the decade. Phase I of this roadmap
incorporated existing instruments --- the Donald C. Backer Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) ---
aimed at characterizing foregrounds and laying the
groundwork for a statistical detection of the HI 21~cm signal through
the power spectrum.  A second-generation HERA instrument would measure
the evolution of the power spectrum, revealing details of the astrophysics driving
the birth and evolution of galaxies 
in the early Universe. A third-generation instrument would
directly image structures throughout reionization.

With a fraction of the funding recommended for HERA Phase I
in NWNH, the MWA and PAPER projects have made
major strides in developing techniques to disentangle
the reionization signal from the strong radio continuum foreground
emission.  These techniques, which are based on a new
understanding of the interplay of foreground and instrumental systematics
in the context of a three-dimensional cosmological intensity-mapping experiment,
have yielded a critical breakthrough.  As discussed below, {\bf we are now able to remove 
foregrounds to the limits of our sensitivity with these instruments},
and this is culminating in the first physically meaningful upper limits
on the power spectrum of 21~cm emission from reionization \citep{parsons_et_al2013}. PAPER
and MWA are now performing deep science observations, with the potential to 
obtain a few sigma?? detection of the HI 21cm signal within two years. 

% last sentence above could go - cc; agreed - JCP
% Carilli: I think the paragraph below is a bit repeditive. 
% In the interest of length, I have commented out and revised below

%Current generation 21~cm reionization experiments (LOFAR, MWA, PAPER) 
%are fully constructed and have been engaged in observations
%that will soon reach the sensitivity limits of these instruments.  Meanwhile,
%the principles that have yielded this breakthrough in foreground removal
%have given us new insight into how
%21~cm reionization experiments should be designed.  
%Based on these insights, we have developed a new 14~m diameter antenna element 
%that is optimized both for
%sensitivity and for minimizing foreground systematics.  
%Arranging these elements in a compact hexagonal grid yields an array that
%facilitates calibration, leverages proven foreground removal techniques, and is scalable
%to large collecting areas.

Building on lessons learned from MWA and PAPER, we have developed a new 14~m diameter antenna element 
optimized both for sensitivity and for minimizing foreground systematics.  
Arranging these elements in a compact hexagonal grid yields an array that
facilitates calibration, leverages proven foreground removal techniques, and is amenable 
to multiple approaches to reionization studies. We are now ready to build the instrument
that delivers HERA-II science at a cost that is substantially below what was originally envisioned in NWNH.
The proposed HERA-331 experiment will have close to two orders of magnitude better
sensitivity than PAPER and MWA, and a wider frequency range (50 to 225~MHz). 
Construction will proceed in two stages, allowing both for technical improvements and the delivery of 
key science throughout the project period: 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]

% JCP: do we have any consistency w.r.t. hyphens? HERA 127 vs. HERA-127
\item HERA~127: A 127 element hexagonal array will be deployed by
the end of proposal year 2. HERA-127 will measure the rise and fall of the
21~cm reionization power spectrum from $z = 7$ to 12. These results will set tight
constrains on the evolution of the IGM neutral fraction, and hence determine
the timing and duration of reionization, in particular during epochs that are difficult or impossible to
probe with other techniques.

\item HERA~331: A 331 element hexagonal array will be deployed by the end of the third year. HERA-331 
will measure fluctuations in the 21~cm signal over a variety of spatial
scales to determine the nature and distribution of the first galaxies
that dominate cosmic reionization. HERA~331 will cover a frequency range adequate to extend precision
power-spectrum observations back to the end of the 'Dark Ages' ($z \sim 20$), 
when the first stars and black holes warm the primordial IGM. HERA-331 will also have the 
sensitivity adequate to image the largest structures in the primordial
IGM --- a task previously only considered possible with third-generation
instruments. 

% ARP: these designs already said below
%Ultimately, HERA-331 will have the sensitivity to
%image directly the largest scale structures in the IGM during reionization.
\end{itemize}

% XXX as above, emphasize the proposal is for the 21cm science; array is a consequence
This proposal is a self-contained package for delivering HERA-II science,
including telescope development, construction, observing, data analysis,
and scientific products for each stage of the project.  As described
in the Project Management Plan, this approach minimizes
risks associated with external funding contingencies while allowing 
collaborators to leverage external resources for augmenting HERA's science.

The {\it cosmic dawn}, the period beginning with the birth of the first stars and culminating with the full
reionization of the IGM 
%SF: Changed time period again
$\sim 1$~Gyr later, represents one of the last unexplored phases in cosmic history. 
This period is rich in both astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. 
The characteristics of the IGM depend on the cosmic density field, the first galaxies (e.g., their typical masses and 
clustering), their constituents (e.g., exotic Pop. III 
stars, more normal stars, stellar remnants, or supermassive black holes), their ultraviolet luminosities (which affect
the IGM ionization and thermal states), the efficiency and abundance of X-ray sources (which affect IGM temperature), 
and cosmological effects like the relative velocity of baryons and dark matter. 
Exploring these early structures, and their interplay with their environment was one of the top three ``{\it priority science objectives chosen by 
the [NWNH] survey committee for the decade 2012-2021.}"

% I have revised below, in light of Fan's comment that we need to highlight how 21cm fits into the broader 
% picture of study of F(HI) and first galaxies

Study of the formation of the first galaxies and their influence on the primordial IGM, is 
among the highets priorities in modern astronomy, 
and a primary driver for many future large telescopes.  Recent measurements from the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} 
have pinned down the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function 
at $z \la 8$ \citep{bouwens_et_al2010, schenker_et_al2013} and have detected a few sources at even greater 
distances \citep{ellis_et_al2013, oesch_et_al2013}. Still, a complete census of the galaxies required for
reionization requires deep observations with, e.g., JWST and ALMA, to reveal the fainter end of the luminosity function. 
In parallel, a number of indirect techniques have been used to constrain the evolution of the neutral fraction
with redshift, although predominantly at the end of reionization. Figure~\ref{fig:x_i_vs_z} summarizes 
these results, including: 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]

\item Observations of resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ by the neutral IGM toward
distant quasars (the `Gunn-Peterson' effect) \citep{fan_et_al2006}.

\item The demographics of Ly$\alpha$ emitting  galaxies \citep{schenker_et_al2012, treu_et_al2013,Faisst_et_al2014}.

\item The Ly$\alpha$ absorption profile toward the most distant quasar ($z = 7.1$) \citep{bolton_et_al2011}.

\item Measurements of the optical depth to reionization based on CMB temperature fluctuations \citep{planck_et_al2013}
and large scale polarization anisotropies \citep{page_et_al2007}.

\item Secondary temperature fluctuations generated by the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect \citep{zahn_et_al2012_trunc, mesinger_et_al2012}. 

\end{itemize}

Results from these observations suggest that the IGM may have been substantially neutral even at $z \sim 7$ (as high as $F_{HI} \sim 0.5$), with a tail of finite ionization extending to high 
redshift ($z \sim 15$).  Unfortunately, these methods (while extremely informative), have limited 
reach as probes of reionization itself. In particular:
(1) probes using Ly$\alpha$ emission can study only the tail-end of reionization, 
due to the extreme optical depth of that transition; (2) inferences from galaxy populations require strong assumptions 
regarding stellar populations, the escape fraction of UV photons from the galaxies, the undetected source population, 
and IGM clumping; and (3) the CMB provides only an integral measure of ionization back to recombination. 
Moreover, many of these indirect observations require substantial modeling and (taken at face value) 
are in tension with one another, underscoring the difficulty of
their interpretation and the complexity of the reionization process.

The 21~cm ``spin-flip" transition of  neutral hydrogen has been recognized as potentially the most powerful probe 
of the cosmic dawn \citep{morales_wyithe2010, furlanetto_et_al2006}, as emphasized in NWNH: 
``{\it 
%SF: Is this quote from the RMS panel?  If so, does it appear in the final report?
The panel concluded that  to explore the discovery area of the epoch of reionization, it is most important to 
develop new capabilities to observe redshifted 21~cm \HI emission, building on the legacy of current projects and 
increasing sensitivity and spatial resolution to characterize the topology of the gas at reionization.}"  Because 
our Universe is almost entirely neutral before reionization, the HI 21~cm line provides a direct method to image 
the evolution of the primordial IGM, opening a unique window into the complex astrophysical interplay between the 
first luminous structures and their surroundings. Moreover, because of the cosmological redshift, we can associate 
the signal at each observed frequency with a particular emission time (or distance) and reconstruct a complete 
three-dimensional picture of the time evolution of large scale structure during this `last frontier' in 
observational cosmology. 
%SF: Personally I feel like the following is an exaggeration that could rub some people the wrong way!
%The direct observation of the primordial IGM via the HI 21~cm line would be an achievement comparable in importance 
%to the detection of anisotropies in the CMB.

Decades of effort have gone into modeling the complex astrophysics of reionization
(e.g. \citealt{shapiro_giroux1987, haiman_loeb1997, furlanetto_et_al2004, santos_et_al2010}). Figure \ref{fig:EoRsims} shows a 
simulation of the expected evolution of the HI 21~cm signal during reionization \citep{mesinger_furlanetto2007}. Fluctuations in the signal initially 
rise above those expected from the cosmic density field due to the growth of ionized bubbles on a characteristic 
scale of a few to 10~arcmin. This scale is set by the clustering of early galaxy formation, as well as by 
propagation effects through the IGM. The signal then declines as the IGM becomes fully ionized.  These theoretical 
models of the reionization process are sophisticated and appear to be well-understood, {\it but they are not 
predictive tools.} Instead, they provide a mapping between the largely unknown galaxy populations and observables 
like the 21~cm transition. As such, the key questions about the cosmic dawn era remain poorly understood.  When 
did reionization occur, and over what timescale?  What objects dominated the radiation field?  How were the 
objects distributed?  What were the most important feedback mechanisms in the transition from the first stars to
first galaxies, and how did they affect these populations?  {\it HERA provides the key measurements needed 
to advance our understanding of early galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.}
%JCP: The above paragraph is very good.

As a high-sensitivity instrument with broad frequency coverage, HERA can
paint an uninterrupted picture of the evolution of the IGM through reionization and into the era of the cosmic dawn.
This capability leverages the coupling of
21~cm emission to the properties of the first galaxies that
are inaccessible through other means  and will be transformative for
studying the imprint of the very first galaxies in the Ly-$\alpha$ and X-ray backgrounds.
Figure~\ref{fig:x_i_vs_z} illustrates how HERA will
determine the ionization history of our universe much more precisely,
and over a wider redshift range (thus at higher neutral fractions), than is possible with other existing techniques.
These measurements will propel us beyond characterizing the timing and duration of reionization and into a regime
of asking detailed astrophysical questions, such as which galaxies dominate the integrated UV luminosity density, what the escape fraction
of UV photons is in early galaxies, and how feedback from early star formation affects low-mass galaxies and
the integrated  global ionization profile versus redshift (see \S\ref{sec:ParamEst}).
At earlier epochs ($z \sim 15$ to 20), the sensitivity of the 21~cm line
to the IGM temperature provides a unique probe of processes that warm the neutral IGM during the cosmic dawn.
HERA will have the low frequency coverage and
sensitivity to study these earliest phases of star and black hole formation -- an epoch that may be otherwise
untestable, even with JWST.

A season of observing with HERA-127 will yield high-significance constraints on the 21 cm power
spectrum across a wide range of wavenumbers and redshifts \citep{pober_et_al2014}.  
Figure \ref{fig:eor_pspec} shows a $z=9$ power spectrum modeled by the 21cmFAST software \citep{mesinger_et_al2011},
along with $2\sigma$ HERA sensitivities.  Using a conservative ``foreground avoidance"
approach pioneered by PAPER \citep{parsons_et_al2013}, we find that
HERA-127 can achieve a $> 10\sigma$ detection over a broad range of redshifts.
Subsequent observing with HERA-331 boosts this to $>25\sigma$.  With detailed foreground modeling techniques
developed for the MWA, the overall significance rises to $90\sigma$,
along with new access to smaller $k$ modes and therefore qualitatively different physics.

Power spectrum measurements with HERA-331 are sensitive enough to place strict constraints on theoretical models of
reionization and even to test the fundamental assumptions of those models.  Within the standard framework,
three terms determine the major features of the power spectrum: $\zeta$, the efficiency at which galaxies
release ionizing photons  into the IGM; $T_{\rm vir}$, the minimum virial temperature of halos that produce
ionizing photons; and $R_{\rm mfp}$, the mean free path of ionizing
photons in the IGM (determined the abundance of optically thick clumps).  Existing
observations limit the values of these parameters to within an order-of-magnitude at best.
Figure \ref{fig:ErrorEllipses} shows that we expect
HERA-331 power spectrum observations to constrain them to better
than 5\% using proven foreground avoidance techniques, with even stronger constraints from
explicit foreground modeling \citep{pober_et_al2014}.

\subsubsection{Imaging HI}
\label{sec:imaging_HI}
%iv. Imaging large scale structure: simulation (Fig)
With a nearly completely sampled aperture over 300~m across, HERA will have the collecting area of Arecibo, but
with $500\times$ the survey speed and sufficiently high sensitivity to image reionization directly.  After 100 hours on a
single field (achievable in 200 nights), HERA will reach a surface brightness sensitivity
of 50~$\mu$Jy/beam (synthesized beam FWHM $\sim 24'$) compared to the brightness temperature fluctuations of up to 400~$\mu$Jy/beam in typical reionization models.

As was the case with the power spectrum, noise and foreground residuals are important limiting factors.  Fortunately, many of the same foreground avoidance and modeling schemes used for power spectrum estimation can also be applied to imaging.  In Figure \ref{fig:imaging} we demonstrate the
resultant sensitivity of imaging in a foreground avoidance scheme, assuming a conservative 1~MHz of effective bandwidth, corresponding to 12~Mpc along the line of
sight.  The brightest structures in the $z=8$ input simulation are detectable at the SNR$>10$ level.
%SF: Is it useful to say how common such features are?  (If we know.)

With high sensitivity throughout its observing band, HERA will push the redshift
frontier of current-generation $21\,\textrm{cm}$ instruments, extending observations to the pre-reionization era  at $z \sim 20$ without interruption.  In standard theoretical models, this will allow a measurement of an earlier peak in the power
spectrum, arising from an era of IGM heating from various X-ray sources, likely dominated by X-rays from black
hole binaries, providing constraints on the rate and density of massive black hole formation in the early universe \citep{pritchard_loeb2010}..  These scenarios allow a wide range of possibilities for IGM heating, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z} (see  \citealt{mesinger_et_al2013}) with HERA's sensitivity overlaid.
Alternate heating sources such as dark matter annihilation cause easily identifiable contributions in some models, and at the higher redshifts, exotic physics such as warm dark matter may also be constrained.  HERA measurements will also be sensitive to velocity streaming between baryonic matter and the dark matter halos, and its effect on early structure formation and the onset of Ly$\alpha$ emission \citep{visbal_et_al2012}.  HERA is \emph{uniquely} poised to take advantage of the pre-reionization era as an unparalleled testbed for both astrophysics and cosmology.

%As seen in  Figure \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z}, the HERA 21~cm observations are sensitive to
%the rate and density of massive black holes formed in the
%early universe \citep{pritchard_loeb2010} via their X-ray emission (see Figure \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z}, right panel),
%how velocity streaming between baryonic
%matter and the dark matter halos affected early structure formation and the onset
%of Ly$\alpha$ emission \citep{visbal_et_al2012}, and will lay the groundwork for future
%efforts to explore how

\subsubsection{Cross-correlation Science}
\label{sec:CrossCorrelation}
%vii. Cross-correlation science:

The ability of HERA to image enables an exciting range of cross-correlation science.
HERA HI images can reveal the large-scale reionization environment for pointed ALMA and JWST
observations and other deep near-IR surveys \citep{lidz_et_al2009}.
Knowing whether an observed galaxy is in a region that  was
previously reionized (center of large HII bubble), recently reionized (edge of HII bubble), or is forming from
pristine HI provides important contextual information on early galaxy formation and especially feedback.
HI images can also be cross-correlated with other diffuse
tracers of large scale structure, including intensity
mapping of molecular  CO \cite{lidz_et_al2011}, atomic CII \citep{gong_et_al2011}, and the H~I Ly$\alpha$ \citep{silva_et_al2013} lines. These studies
trace the large scale galaxy distribution -- the sources of reionization — and cross-correlation 
with IGM images can break degeneracies within both data sets. Prototypes of such experiments
may be operating contemporaneously with HERA. Such probes have different systematics
compared to HERA, so cross-correlations will provide clean measurements of the underlying signal.

The HERA project team consists of PIs and technical leaders from four NSF-funded projects targeting the 21cm signal
at high redshifts:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
% XXX list PIs/tech leads as well?

\item{PAPER} (NSF grants \#1129258, \#0804508, \#0607838, and \#0505354) has followed a
staged development approach, maintaining a test array in Green Bank, WV for technical development and testing, with subsequent 
deployment to the science array in the SKA radio quiet zone in the Karoo, South Africa.  Starting with a 16 element
array in 2009 in the Karoo, PAPER has doubled its size annually for four years running, culminating in the current
128 element array (Figure \ref{fig:hera_dish}, bottom left; \citealt{parsons_et_al2012a}).
%JCP: Parsons 2012a seems like an odd cite here... Parsons 2010? 
PAPER pioneered the use of redundant antenna configurations
for power-spectrum measurements, the use of drift-scanning elements,
a scalable correlator architecture,
and real-time 40-fold data compression based on delay/delay-rate filtering.
PAPER pioneered the delay-spectrum foreground avoidance technique \citep{parsons_et_al2012b},
and applied it to observations (Fig. \ref{fig:eor_pspec}; \citealt{parsons_et_al2013}).
The resulting power spectrum improved the best upper
limit on reionization by almost two orders of magnitude in mK$^2$, and was used to show that the early IGM must have
been heated prior to reionization --- presumably by emission from high-mass X-ray binaries.

\item{The MWA} (NSF grants \#0457585, \#082132, \#1109257), 
located at the future SKA-low site
in Western Australia, was developed as a large international collaboration.  It consists
of 128 digitally steerable antenna tiles (Fig. \ref{fig:hera_dish}, upper left;
\citealt{tingay_et_al2013_trunc}), arranged in an imaging configuration, and operating from 80 to 300 MHz.
%The MWA's hardware performance \citep{bowman_et_al2007a}, calibration pipeline
%\citep{mitchell_et_al2008}, and foreground subtraction strategy \citep{morales_et_al2006a}
%are well documented. 
The US MWA team is a world leader in the application of image-based modeling techniques 
(Fig. \ref{fig:twoFGViews}, left) to
foreground subtraction (e.g. \citealt{hazelton_et_al2013,morales_et_al2006a}). %for enlarging the EoR window for power spectral studies, 
Recent MWA observations have
demonstrated the subtraction of foregrounds to the thermal noise limit in regions dominated by systematics using
delay-spectrum analysis techniques (Fig. \ref{fig:twoFGViews}, right).
%and enabling imaging of reionization (Figure
%\ref{fig:eor_pspec}). The resulting analysis is more complex than the
%delay-spectrum approach (e.g.\ \citealt{hazelton_et_al2013}) but 
%naturally
Such techniques will potentially
expand the number of modes available to HERA for measuring the 21~cm reionization signal,
and can suppress polarized foregrounds that may enter delay-spectrum measurments near
the level of the reionization signal \citep{moore_et_al2013}. 
%comparison with observations at other bands. 

\item{MITEoR} (NSF grants \#1105835, \#0908848) is 64-element array 
examining novel cross-correlation and calibration techniques for 21~cm reionization experiments.
While spatial-FFT cross-correlation
techniques remain under development, MITEoR brings critical expertise in redundancy-based calibration
and quadratic power-spectrum estimation techniques.

\item{LEDA} (NSF grant \#1106045) is a 256-element array targeting the
global 21cm reionization signal.  Werthimer and Greenhill collaboratively 
pioneered the application of graphics processing units (GPUs) in digital correlators.
This technology was adopted in recent PAPER deployments, and will be applied to HERA's correlator
and data-compression systems.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
Other projects invoving HERA team members that have undertaken significant hardware development and
completed major deployments include the EDGES experiment (NSF grants \#1207761, \#0905990),
the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER; NSF grant \#0906040), the Advanced Multibeam
Spectrometer for the GBT (NSF grant \#1006509), and numerous other efforts.  Theoretical work includes Furlanetto's 
%\noindent {\bf Furlanetto:} Furlanetto held 
NSF grant AST-0829737, ``Theoretical Models of Helium Reionization"  
%(an institutional transfer of AST-0607470; these two grants provide \$358,486 over the period 9/1/2006--8/31/2009).  This grant led to 13 journal articles, published over the period 2007--2010, with several more in the years since. The primary broader impact were training a graduate student, Keri Dixon, 
which created and publicly distributed the semi-numeric reionization code, DexM.
These projects have a strong record of publishing ground-breaking research in peer-reviewed literature, and
bring to HERA mature hardware designs, software pipelines, and powerful analysis frameworks.
HERA's leadership also brings substantial experience
collaborating internationally, managing the design, development, testing, and integration of complex systems,
adhering to project timelines and budgets, and setting incremental development and deployment plans that
ensure that progress is made on a predictable schedule, with time to adapt to contingencies.

\subsection{Lessons for HERA}

% XXX goal: trim out mention of wedge before here, except for a very brief mention in overview

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{plots/waterfall_filtered.png}
\caption{\small 
Waterfall plots illustrating, as a function of time and frequency, PAPER visibilities

delay filter that removes forground emission within the wedge.  Color scale indicates amplitude in $\log_{10}({\rm Jy})$.
This filter suppresses
foreground systematics by at least 4 orders of magnitude, leaving residuals demonstrably noise-dominated, and preserving the epoch of reionization signal.
}\label{fig:waterfall} \end{figure}


The key challenge of 21~cm reionization experiments is 
balancing the collecting area needed to detect the faint reionization signal
with the precision needed to suppress
foregrounds that are $\sim$5 orders of magnitude brighter \citep{deolivieracosta_et_al2008}.
Previously, it was assumed that careful calibration and image-based model subtraction would be the keys to overcoming these foregrounds.
While such efforts are being actively pursued, and are likely to be important to the field in the future,
it has become clear that the community underestimated the challenges associated with this approach.
The major breakthrough for 21~cm reionization experiments --- what enables us to propose HERA now --- is 
the discovery of how 
instrumentation and analysis can instead exploit the 
spectral smoothness of foregrounds 
to open up a window for accessing the reionization signal. 
%These advances have been pioneered by the MWA and PAPER teams \citep{morales_et_al2012,parsons_et_al2012b,vedantham_2012,Datta_2010,hazelton_et_al2013,pober_et_al2013,parsons_et_al2013,dillon_et_al2013b}, and enable us to design a targeted HERA instrument that can reveal the details of reionization (Figure \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z}) and image the largest structures (Figure \ref{fig:imaging}).
As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:waterfall}, these advances have been used to suppress foreground emission by at least 4
orders of magnitude in PAPER observations,
with results that begin ruling out certain reionization scenarios
\citep{parsons_et_al2013}.

%Observations for 21~cm cosmology experiments are best understood in Fourier space.  
For redshifted (21~cm) line emission, each observing frequency maps to
a line-of-sight distance.  Hence, measurements as a function of frequency and angle 
to enable 21~cm reionization experiments to map a cosmological volume $\{x,y,z\}$ in
comoving Mpc.  For power-spectrum measurements, this observed volume is Fourier transformed into a 
wavenumber cube $\k\equiv\{k_{x}, k_{y}, k_{z}\}$, where 
$\kperp\equiv\{k_{x},k_{y}\}$ represents angular Fourier modes that are directly
related to the $(u,v)$ modes sampled by baselines of an interferometer, and $\kpar\equiv k_{z}$ is
a line-of-sight wavenumber.
%Interferometric measurements are of the angular Fourier modes in many
%frequency channels (visibilities), so in the absence of widefield effects only
%a Fourier transform in the frequency direction and a coordinate mapping is
%needed to obtain the 3D $\{k_{x}, k_{y}, k_{z}\}$ measurements
%\citep{morales_hewitt2004}.) 
The expected statistical isotropy of the signal allows measurements in $k$-space to be
squared and averaged in shells to produce the spherical power spectrum
shown in Figure \ref{fig:eor_pspec}.

%region), where measurements are thermal-noise limited.  
The width of the wedge derives both from an instrument-independent component 
(solid black line) and an additional component relating to the inherent spectral smoothness
of both the foregrounds and the instrument response.

%Bright foregrounds occupy

%This insight has led to the
%first meaningful constraints on EoR via 21~cm emission
%\citep{parsons_et_al2013}.
}\label{fig:twoFGViews} \end{figure}


%Imaging-based approaches combine baseline measurements to
%invert the $\kpar\Leftrightarrow(u,v)$ modes natively
%sampled by an interferometer, and then aim to calibrate out the inherent chromaticity of an
%interferometer's $(u,v)$-sampling to enable the accurate subtraction of foreground models.
Rather than inverting interferometric baseline measurements to produce images,
a powerful new approach has been developed and tested by the PAPER
and MWA teams that instead directly Fourier transforms these measurements separately along the frequency axis,
effectively producing a wavenumber cube while retaining the ability to handle inteferometric
chromaticity on a per-baseline basis.  Because of the way smooth-spectrum foregrounds
interact with baselines of different lengths, it turns out this flexibility to handle
baselines separately is critical.
Through a concerted theoretical and observational campaign by PAPER and the MWA
\citep{morales_et_al2012,parsons_et_al2012b,vedantham_2012,Datta_2010,hazelton_et_al2013,pober_et_al2013,parsons_et_al2013,dillon_et_al2013b},
we now understand that foreground contamination is confined to a `wedge' in
$\kpar$ vs.\ $\kperp$, as demonstrated by the PAPER observations in 
Figure \ref{fig:twoFGViews} (right).  Moreover, because the $\kpar$ direction (obtained by
Fourier-transforming along the frequency axis) is effectively an ``inverse frequency'' (e.g. time delay),
the form of this wedge can be understood analytically as arising from the relative delay between sky signals
entering each antenna in an interferometric baseline from different directions.

Our new understanding of the foreground wedge has two powerful consequences.
Firstly, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:waterfall}, the foreground wedge can
removed with a baseline-dependent filter that removes emission within a well-defined range of spectral smoothness.
This filter directly suppresses foregrounds by at least
4 orders of magnitude,  
and leaves the region above the wedge free from 
foreground emission --- a window through which we can observe the reionization signal.
Secondly, by understanding signal delay as the mechanism that gives rise to the wedge,
it is now possible, for the first time, to map foreground removal requirements 
to the precise instrumental characteristics that are required.  The most direct instrumental
constraint comes from that fact that, to access $\k$-modes in the range $0.1<k<0.2h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
where 21~cm reionization experiments can be most sensitive, {\bf the signal delay between antennas
contributing to this measurement cannot exceed 120 ns}.  As discussed in \S\ref{sec:design}, this
constraint can (and must) be incorporated into the fundamental design of any future 21~cm reionization instrument.
%JCP: is this the signal delay between antennas or within an antenna???

%%MM: a figure showing results from both arrays would be really powerful here.
%This wedge is the result of
%the smooth spectrum foregrounds 
%%XXX SF: I would make this more obvious.  I recommend replacing this sentence with something like (with my naive understanding): "This sharp division occurs because foregrounds have smooth spectra (which cause the sources to manifest at small $\kpar$), some of which is projected into the transverse direction ($\kperp$) through the instrument's well-understood chromatic properties."
%(low $\kpar$) interacting with the inherent
%chromaticity of an interferometer. 
%This leaves the region above the wedge free from 
%foreground emission---a window through which we can observe the EoR. 
%As demonstrated in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:waterfall}, removal of the foreground wedge 
%directly suppresses foregrounds by at least 4 orders of magnitude.
%We now understand the source of the EoR window, how we can increase the 21~cm signal region, and have seen the window in observations with both PAPER and the MWA \citep{pober_et_al2013,dillon_et_al2013b}.
%
%%The time is now ripe for an experiment that builds from the technical heritage
%%of PAPER, the MWA, MITEoR, and LEDA, and incorporates into the design of the

%%These elements, arranged redundantly in a compact hexagonal grid, enable both the

%%\citep{sullivan_et_al2012_trunc} and the imaging power spectrum

%Observations with PAPER and the MWA have confirmed the presence of the EoR Window
%\citep{pober_et_al2013,dillon_et_al2013b}, and recent PAPER observations
%have measured the foreground suppression within it
%to be at least 4 orders of magnitude 
%(8 in mK$^2$;
%\citealt{parsons_et_al2013}).
%This is a major advance---we can
%suppress foregrounds and we understand the instrumental and analysis
%characteristics needed to perform the EoR measurement.
%
%Understanding the origin of the EoR Window has enabled us to improve our
%instrumentation and analysis 
%tools to precisely measure the 21~cm
%signal. HERA's antennas (see \S \ref{PDsec}) are optimized 
%to yield $\sim$20
%times the sensitivity per element (relative to PAPER) without substantially degrading
%foreground isolation,
%and we have developed new imaging and
%analysis techniques to suppress polarized source contamination to below the EoR
%signal within the window \citep{bernardi_2013_trunc,moore_et_al2013}.
%Together, these advances provide the necessary foreground suppression and
%a game-changing level of sensitivity at a fraction of the
%cost anticipated in the HERA roadmap.

% XXX possibly pull some of the sentences below for HERA Lessons section above.

%The HERA collaboration has made significant progress on multiple approaches in dealing with
%foregrounds.
%Based on a ``delay-spectrum'' understanding of
%the mechanism for how instrumental responses modulate foregrounds on
%spectral scales of cosmological interest \citep{parsons_et_al2012b},
%PAPER has optimized its instrument to focus on regions in Fourier
%space that have weak coupling to foregrounds caused by the
%interferometer.  These regions are determined both by chromatic
%instrumental responses and by the inherent frequency structure of the
%foregrounds.  An `EoR window' has been identified in the Fourier
%(wavenumber) space of spectral and angular power spectra that is
%inherently free of continuum emission, without explicit continuum
%subtraction in either the image or spectral domain \citep{pober_et_al2013,morales_et_al2012,Datta_2010}
%This window allows for continuum
%`avoidance' rather than subtraction. Observations based on this new
%approach have already demonstrated that the extremely stringent level
%of foreground suppression needed to access the 21~cm signal is largely
%in hand (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pk_k3pk}), with upper limits
%that are beginning to rule out cold reionization scenarios \citep{parsons_et_al2013}.

%JCP: we switch here from 21~cm ro 21cm.  

As described in \S\ref{sec:Lessons}, 21cm reionization efforts have achieved a
pivotal new understanding of how instrumental characteristics give rise the
wedge of emission shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoFGViews}.  Furthermore, we have
measurements that prove the efficacy, to the sensitivity limits of current
instruments, of simply projecting out foreground-dominated wavemodes within the
wedge.  For the first time, the 21cm community is now in a position to define
the top-level instrument requirements that ensure foregrounds remain bounded
within a wedge of known size, and to specify the sensitivity needed to obtain
high-significance detections of the 21cm reionization power spectrum under the
conservative assumption that all foreground-dominated wavemodes within the
wedge must be projected out of our measurements.
As summarized in Table \ref{tab:signif} (see \citealt{pober_et_al2014} for more details),
based on these assumptions, current instruments are likely to achieve,
at best, only marginal detections of power from reionization.
% XXX expand this into a larger discussion of where HERA fits in with other activities?

%HERA follows the vision delineated in NWNH where the MWA and PAPER
%characterized the foreground emission and performed the first deep
%integrations, followed by a more powerful instrument that drew on the lessons
%learned and merged the scientific teams. The MWA, PAPER, and LOFAR have all
%recently started deep integrations with hopes of detecting the 21~cm
%signal.
%However, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:signif} (see \citealt{pober_et_al2014} for more details),
%these instruments are likely to achieve
%at best only marginal detections of power from reionization.
%While this might qualify as a ``detection'' if the signal is strong, the
%\emph{science} of reionization observations is beyond their reach. 
%However, the profound contributions of MWA and PAPER should not be overlooked. PAPER and the MWA have succeeded magnificently in characterizing the foreground emission, discovering the EoR window, and understanding how to remove foreground contamination from the measurements. Further, they have developed and retired the risk associated with all of HERA's major systems. 
%HERA uses these lessons perform the science of reionization, at a much lower cost than assumed in NWNH.
%% XXX keep mentioning
%% that this proposal is cheaper than NWNH suggested but never give either that
%% number nor your estimated cost.

This HERA proposal targets two arrays: a 127-element array that borrows heavily
from components of the PAPER experiment, and an upgraded 331-element array that
incorporates several performance optimizations.  As listed in Table \ref{tab:signif}, the specifications of HERA-127
and HERA-331 have been set to meet precisely the requirements for obtaining,
respectively, a 10$\sigma$ detection of the 21cm reionization signal across a broad range of redshifts, and a
25$\sigma$ detection of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the 21~cm signal
capable of determining the nature and distribution of the first galaxies that
dominate cosmic reionization.  The sensitivity requirements of these arrays are
driven by the additional requirement that foreground systematics must
drop below the level of the 21~cm reionization signal for measurements
above $k_\parallel=0.1h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, as shown by the conservative
sensitivity curves in Figure \ref{fig:eor_pspec}.

Using the delay-spectrum formalism, we can understand this requirement as an 
assertion that the length of time it takes a signal to traverse the distance
between two adjacent antennas, plus the delay associated with any internal signal reflections, 
cannot exceed 120 ns.  More specifically, any signals reflections at delays higher
than 120 ns must be attenuated by the -60 dB factor that represents the ratio in
amplitude of the foreground signals to the expected level of the 21~cm reionization signal.
The requirements for signal delay,
sensitivity, and cost minimization almost uniquely determine many aspects of the 
the HERA design that is described in more detail below.

%incorporates
%our proven foreground avoidance techniques while improving
%dramatically the sensitivity relative to current experiments.  With a
%new understanding of how antenna size and separation affect
%sensitivity and foreground isolation, it has become evident a revision
%of the PAPER antenna design can yield up to 20 times the sensitivity
%per element without substantially degrading foreground isolation.
%Where PAPER's elements lack collecting area and are smaller than
%strictly required for foreground isolation, and the majority of MWA
%and LOFAR elements are spaced too widely to avoid foregrounds,
%HERA-331 employs an extremely compact array of 14-m parabolic dishes
%with PAPER-style dipole feeds (see Figure \ref{fig:hera_dish}).  The dishes
%are placed in a compact hexagonal configuration of 331 dishes supplemented by 18 outrigger dishes to achieve dense and
%highly-redundant $uv$-sampling (see Figures \ref{fig:uv_coverage} and \ref{fig:config_optics}).  The dishes have a short (4.5m) focal height to limit the
%path length of reflections, whose time-delay gives rise to chromatic
%instrumental systematics.

\subsection{Instrument Design}
%\vspace{-6pt}
\label{InstDes}
%The HERA instrument design is very straightforward.  The element
%itself is a fixed zenith-pointing 14-meter segmented prime-focus paraboloid with a high screen
%to minimize cross-talk between elements (which are spaced 14.3 meters on a
%hexagonal grid).   The $f/D$ of
%the paraboloid is 0.32, so that the focal length, $f$, is less than 5 meters to meet the 
%standing wave specification at the delays of interest of more than 60 dB of attenuation at delays 
%greater than 50 ns.
%
%
%The active feed sends back the entire dual-polarization analog bandwidth on standard
%coaxial cable to an aggregation point called a ``node'', which services 
%about 15 antennas.  This cable length is kept short (35-m) to keep any standing
%wave contamination outside of the delay-space of interest for power spectrum
%measurements.  The node amplifies, filters, digitizes and transmits the signal data stream
%back to the central processing location (the Karoo Array Processing Building - KAPB).
%Figure \ref{fig:blockDiagram} shows a block diagram of the system.

\subsubsection{Antenna Element}
%\vspace{-6pt}

Although deceptively simple, the novel design of HERA's antenna element
(Fig. \ref{fig:hera_dish}, right panel) represents the critical advance
that enables HERA to achieve its science goals.  This 14-m
fixed zenith-pointing parabolic dish yields more than 10 times the
sensitivity of an MWA tile (and more 20 times
that of a PAPER element), but does so without substantially degrading
our ability to isolate and remove foreground emission on the basis of
spectral smoothness.  As described above, this is done by limiting by 
the timescale of signal delays and reflections to under 120 ns.

Since the time it takes radio emission to propagate between adjacent antennas 
represents a significant portion of this time budget, HERA elements must be placed close together.
Recent work characterizing foregrounds suggests that 
antenna separations of $8\lambda \approx 15$m are
well-behaved to current limits \citep{pober_et_al2013,parsons_et_al2013}. This influences our
choice of a 14-m dish diameter,
which incurs 42 ns of signal delay between adjacent antennas.
The focal height of the dish is influenced both by the illumination pattern of the prime-focus
feed (which must effectively illuminate the reflector), and the fact that reflections
between the feed and the element%,
%caused by imperfect impedance matching between the feed electronics and free space, 
can introduce additional signal delay.  A focal height of 4.5 m
strikes a balance between dish illumination and signal reflections.  
With a splash cone underneath the feed to scatter reflections, we assume -20 dB
attenuation per reflection, so that after three traversals (13.5 m; 41 ns), reflections from
foreground emission are below the expected level of the 21~cm reionization signal.
Additional measures, such as screens that isolate feeds from one another, and using
non-metallic cabling and poles for supporting the feeds, are all aimed at minimizing
the potential for additional sources of signal reflections.
The total signal delay associated with the HERA dish design is estimated at 83 ns, leaving
headroom for reflections arising in the analog signal path.

Cost is another design constraint, including the price of construction
materials, assembly in a remote area, and maintenance over the operational
lifetime of the array.  Care has been taken to select robust and inexpensive
construction materials (PVC, concrete, utility poles, 0.25" wire cloth) and an assembly methodology that delivers the required positional
accuracy of 10 cm and surface accuracy of 2 cm given standard expertise in construction
practices for the subcontracted teams that will set the poles and construct the
elements in the field.  
%JCP: "required positional accuracy" -- what drives the requirement?
Given the sensitivity and signal delay requirements, the size of HERA
dishes optimizes a global costing curve that includes the costs of the elements,
the signal path, correlation, data storage, and processing.

%As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:heracles}, 
The basic design of the HERA dish
is complete, and the first prototype is nearly completely constructed.  Lessons from the
construction process will be fed back into the design, as will results from currently
on-going reflectometry tests that measure the return from pulsed transmissions from the
feed to characterize signal reflection amplitudes and delays.  In this proposal,
two further prototype elements will be constructed in the first year in Green Bank, WV,
alongside an existing PAPER array for on-sky measurements of the beam pattern and spectral 
response.
These measurements will be coupled with full electromagnetic modeling to validate
and refine the element design prior to a Critical Design Review at the end of the first project
year.  Thereafter, three revised elements will be constructed on the HERA site in South Africa, involving
lead members of the construction subcontract teams for a Project Readiness Review.  Thereafter,
element construction will proceed continously through the second and third project years during the day,
with a staged incorporation of new elements for night-time observing.

%\end{figure}

% FOLLOWING SEEMS TOO DETAILED FOR A PROPOSAL
%To distinguish between measured sky delays and instrumental-induced delays at a required threshold ($R_T$) dB, 
%we need sufficient attenuation of the reflected signals at a given focal length ($f$) at a specified delay ($\tau_{d}$).  Assuming a conservative simple model that the magnitude of the reflection is attenuated by $A$ dB at each reflection 
%we see that for a delay length limit of $\delta_{d}=c\tau_{d}$ and focal length $f$,  the required focal length is
%
%\begin{equation}
%f < \left(\frac{A}{R_T}\right)\delta_d.
%\end{equation}
%
%Using nominal values of $R_T$ =  60dB (an order of
%magnitude below where EoR is predicted to be below foregrounds) at delays
%corresponding to the time it takes travel 15m and a net attenuation of 20 dB per reflection, 
%we find that the focal length should be less than about 5 m.  Free-space loss effects would 
%increase that value, loosening the constraint.
%DETAILEND

%In addition to the constraints given by the element itself, the HERA element size is
%also influenced by the location of the ``knee'' in the EoR power spectrum \citep{lidz_et_al2008}
%The EoR power spectrum has an upward slope for low $k$-modes which levels off
%around $k=0.15 h$/Mpc %(see fig blah). 
%Working inside this $k$-mode would be beneficial due to the fact foregrounds are
%less problematic. This poses a problem because without knowing the
%width of our foregrounds, we can't say for sure which $k$-modes (in the power
%spectrum) are corrupted. This uncertainty, coupled with increasing systematic affects for shorter 
%baselines (hence smaller diameters), favors larger diameter antennas.

%The $k$-mode for a $14m$ baseline is $k = 0.023$, given by $k_{H} =
%\frac{B}{c}\frac{dk}{d\eta}$, where $B$ is the length of the baseline, 14m in
%our case, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\frac{dk}{d\eta}$ is the cosmological
%transfer function from delays to $k$-modes. In addition, narcissistic
%reflections add into our $k$ budget as well. The $f$ and $D$ choices above provide a $k$ budget for
%foreground widths to be within $\Delta{k}\sim{0.1}$. Testing these hypothesis
%and again, finding a compromise between maximum sensitivity, foreground budget
%will be key to testing and constructing the required element. Foreground width constraints
%are still an area of active research \citep{pober_et_al2013}.

% The core defining elements in this design are the central hub and three tall support poles.  Three intermediate 
% support posts are installed between each pair of poles.  A 2$^{\prime\prime}$ PVC spar of 24.1$^{\prime}$ 
% terminates at each pole and post.  These spars are supported at each end and one point in the middle at the 
% proper height and angle.  The intervening PVC pipe essentially acts as a smoothing filter between those 
% points, noting also that a beam with point loads attains nearly the quadratic shape desired.  The CAD model is 
% shown in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:hera_dish}.  
% 
% The tall ($\sim$ 7m) poles provide locational accuracy (in all three dimensions) for the overall array installation.  
% Using conventional commercial pole-installation techniques the poles are installed first for the entire array.  
% Note that every pole except for the edge poles are shared by three antennas.  A standard theodolite can 
% then be used to mark a known level height on all three poles.  These locations are then used with tensioned 
% lines to define the center of that element and the hub is positioned at that location using a jig.
% 
% The hub uses concentric commercially available ``sonotube'' forms (circular cardboard forms for concrete pillars) 
% and PVC sleeves to hold the PVC spars and PVC supports.  The retaining holes may be accurately cut into 
% the forms, sleeves installed and concrete poured to make a simple hub to the desired accuracy.  The jig holds 
% the concentric rings in place and allows it to be centered by tensioned lines while the concrete is poured.  
% When the concrete cures one can then transfer an accurate offset from the dish vertex back to the poles.
% The intermediate posts are then located by the support sub-assemblies attached to the poles and posts along 
% with the rim sub-assemblies.  These are positioned and a small pier is poured to locate them.  After spar support 
% pieces are installed on the posts, the spars themselves and the metal cloth can be installed.
% 
% The feed is held off the three tall poles using tensioned lines to accurately locate it over the hub.  A precise 
% length of kevlar rope holds the feed down to the hub at a precise focal point.  The RF cables follow the line 
% down and out to the analog-to-digital converters and correlator.  
% 
% To minimize cross-talk, metal screens are strung between every pole/post, which go to the level of the feed.  
% The dishes have a rim-to-rim spacing of 30cm to allow the screen to be slightly angled to minimize standing waves.

}\label{fig:uv_coverage}
\end{figure}

For HERA-127 and HERA-331, elements are arranged in a compact hexagonal grid.
This configuration minimizes antenna separation, which is critical for meeting
the science requirements for foreground isolation.  This hexagonal grid also
produces a highly redundant sampling of the $uv$ plane.  As described in
\S\ref{sec:Lessons}, redundant configurations have been employed by PAPER to
boost sensitivity \citep{parsons_et_al2012a}, with the added benefit that they
greatly facilitate fast and accurate calibration
\citep{liu_et_al2010,parsons_et_al2013}.  Finally, placing HERA elements in a
grid allows certain construction components to be re-used between antennas,
reducing cost, and improving the accuracy of element placement.  HERA-127 will
be a subset of HERA-331, with construction proceeding outward from the eastern
corner of the array.

Because of the size of the elements and the extent of the array, the HERA-331 core will naturally have substantial
imaging capability that can be leveraged for developing foreground suppression techniques
to improve HERA's access to the 21~cm reionization signal 
(Fig. \ref{fig:eor_pspec}, black).
This capability will be augmented with 21 outrigger elements.  These outriggers
combine with the dense core to tile hexagonal regions of sampling around the $uv$ plane, generating a fully
sampled $uv$ plane out to 400$\lambda$.  While outriggers on the north/western sides of the array are
placed in alignment with the hexagonal grid in the core, elements on the south/eastern side of the array are
shifted off-grid to super-sample the $uv$ plane within 400$\lambda$ at finer scales than the spacing
between elements.  This sampling strategy has the benefit of both helping eliminate grating lobes in the
synthesized beam for imaging, and it provides information at the sub-aperture level in the $uv$ plane that
can be used to calibrate and correct for the direction-dependent antenna responses.  This correction may
be of significant importance for improving the match between the XX and YY polarization beams of HERA elements
and helping eliminate polarization leakage.

\end{figure}

HERA's analog signal path inherits directly from PAPER.
In keeping with a philosophy of
incremental change,
HERA-127 will re-use the tested and commissioned feed, LNA, cables, and post-amplifier gain modules
(Fig. \ref{fig:components}, left and center) that are currently being
used to good effect in PAPER-128 \citep{parsons_et_al2010}.  Existing PAPER feeds will be attached to new
reflector screens that are suspended over the elements, but will otherwise remain unmodified.
A parallel development effort an NRAO, led by Bradley, will aim to improving the feed response below
100 MHz 
and to improve the match between polarization beams in the feed-element system.  
Additional
minor modifications to the analog signal path will include transitioning from a 75$\Omega$ to a
shorter 50$\Omega$ cabling system and replacing 100--200 MHz bandpass filters with 50--250 MHz equivalents.
This wider analog bandwidth will be used in HERA analysis to improve the extrapolation of smooth foreground
emission over a broader range, and to explore HERA's capability as a Dark-Ages science instrument.
After a Critical Design Review, the results of these development efforts will be incorporated in
the transition to the HERA-331 system.  

%The signal is transported to the node via a 35-meter run of 50 $\Omega$ coaxial
%cables. It will terminate on a bulkhead plate on the face of the RFI-tight and
%air-conditioned node. Inside, dual-channel post-amplifier modules (PAMs) (Fig.

}\label{fig:casper_boards}
\end{figure}

HERA's digital system continues in the vein of PAPER's digital correlators.
Although correlators have historically been one of the most complex,
expensive, and risky aspects of developing a radio interferometer, this is no longer the case.
The Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research
(CASPER; \citealt{parsons_et_al2006}), founded seven years ago at Berkeley
by Werthimer and Parsons, open-sourced the development of digital signal processing (DSP) engines for astronomy.
CASPER now has world-wide participation,
with over 500 members at 73 institutions, and 
five generations of DSP hardware (Fig. \ref{fig:casper_boards}). 
On a modest budget, PAPER has applied CASPER technology to develop and deploy new correlators
annually for five years running, each quadrupling the computational capacity of its predecessor.
HERA will continue this incremental development cycle, following the packet-switched
FX correlator architecture described in \citet{parsons_et_al2008} that has been
extended in recent PAPER and LEDA deployments (Fig. \ref{fig:components}, right)
to use leverage the computing strengths of both FPGAs and GPUs \citep{clark_et_al2011}.

While HERA-127 will use the existing PAPER correlator directly, for
HERA-331, this correlator architecture will continue to evolve.  As discussed in previous sections,
HERA's science requirements dictate a maximum analog signal path.  As a consequence,
digitization needs to happen close to the antenna
elements in the field.  This specification, along with a growing need for modularity to scale with the number of parallel signal paths,
leads HERA to adopt a node-based architecture for amplification, digitization, channelization, and digital
transmission in the field that builds on HERA's MWA heritage.  This architecture is merged with PAPER's clean 
architecture for real-sampling and channelizing the entire analog passband at once, packetizing the data into
10 Gb Ethernet format, and relying on commercial switches to perform the frequency/antenna corner-turn that
FX correlator architectures require.

\noindent
{\bf Node}. HERA-331 will employ RFI-tight node enclosures that each contain the final gain and digitization stages for
signals from 18 antennas, along with power supplies, cooling, and a small server for monitor/control.  
As part of HERA development,
a new board called the Smart Network ADC Processor (SNAP) board will be incorporated 
into the CASPER suite of hardware and firmware. This inexpensive board was co-designed by UC Berkeley and NRAO to be
both digitizer and F-engine in HERA's FX correlator architecture,
and is currently in layout at NRAO.  Each SNAP board 
digitizes and channelizes a 50--250 MHz band for 6 input signals (3 antennas, dual-polarization).
A 100-MHz band of selectable channels is transmitted over optical fiber
to a central container (see below), and on to the Karoo Array Processing Building (KAPB).  Development and integration of the SNAP
design and the node system will be led at UC Berkeley and after a Critical Design Review, will be fabricated
under subcontracts to industry partners in the third project year, and deployed as part of the HERA-331 system.
Development activities under this proposal include porting the CASPER toolflow to
the SNAP board, designing and testing the FPGA firmware,
the integrating and testing of all components in the node subsystem, and providing a monitor/control
access interface.  If time allows, optional development may include doubling the transmitted bandwidth.

\noindent
{\bf Central Container}.
HERA's central container sits adjacent to the array and houses two significant subsystems.  The first is a timing subsystem
that is responsible for maintaining a GPS-disciplined oscillator and distributing timing
signals (the sampling clock and 1PPS synchronization) to each of the nodes.  The second
subsystem is a passive fiber optic patch panel that couples
the optical network attached to the nodes into a 192-filament optical fiber bundle 
that carries the signals on to the KAPB. 

\noindent
{\bf Karoo Array Processing Building (KAPB)}.
The KAPB is currently
in advanced stages of construction for MeerKAT, and will house the switch and processors
that 
complete the HERA correlator system.  The fiber optic bundle that enters the KAPB patch
into local fiber optic cables 
% XXX and possible demux here
that each terminate in optical transceivers that plug into a 240-port 10 GbE switch.
Such switches, while large, are readily available commercially today.  Also connected to
this switch are 30 servers, each hosting two dual-GPU graphics cards and two dual
10 GbE network interface cards, which implement the cross-multiplication (X-Engine) component
of the correlator during observations.  This estimate for the number of X-Engine servers
is extrapolated from current GPU servers deployed on PAPER, assuming no improvement in bus
speeds for transfering data into the GPU cores, but assuming that the computational
capacity of such GPU cores doubles according to Moore's Law prior to the purchase of
these servers in the third year of the project.
Output data from the correlator are written to the data storage system described
in the following section.

\item 6 network attached storage (NAS) units plus 2 125 TB RAID array units that are used to ship compressed data products to the US, and
\item a permanent 250 TB system at UPenn associated with a computing cluster that

\end{itemize}
\noindent
This effort leverages existing infrastructure at UPenn, with support
for the expansion of the data storage and for upgrading to a 30-node computing cluster.  This cluster will support the bulk of the analysis by HERA collaborators (see \S\ref{sec:analysis}) that requires access to the full set of HERA observations.

%The main data center at Penn will house all of the maximally compressed data from all seasons of HERA, as well as the LST-averaged data.  The storage system is sized so that there is a factor of 4 overhead for work on the maximally-compressed data set, and a factor of 2 on the LST-averaged. The 500 TB data storage will be coupled to a 32-node cluster which performs the tasks of calibration and averaging to further reduce the data volume.  This cluster will support the bulk of the analysis requiring the full data set.  Subsets will be served off to collaborators from this system.  The entire data storage and transfer plan for HERA draws heavily on the experience with PAPER data.

The data compression scheme at the heart of the data management system
has been implemented for PAPER (\citealt{parsons_et_al2013},
Appendix A), and will be applied to HERA visibilities to reduce data volume by
a factor of $\sim$20 without impacting reionization science
capabilities.  This compression technique, which is based on delay/delay-rate
filtering \citep{parsons_backer2009}, is applied uniformly to all visibilities
in the array, does not require (or produce) detailed calibration
information, and is minimally restrictive for how data are analyzed and calibrated afterward.
Data compression is run on the same GPU servers
that implement the correlator X-Engines (\S\ref{sec:digital}).  Since HERA only observes at night,
these processors would otherwise be unused.  UC Berkeley is responsible for porting
the existing data compression pipeline to target these servers.

Data quality assurance (QA) is performed in real time on an additional modest 
computing cluster in the
KAPB.  UPenn will lead the deployment and support of the hardware system that
manages data transfer, applies routine calibration pipelines (see \S\ref{sec:calibration}) and quality
checks, and aggregates correlation-based metrics of array performance in real-time.  The QA system
furnishes this information into the separate monitor and control system (\S\ref{sec:monitor}).
A modest amount of data transfer is possible over the internet; PAPER's data transfer rate from the Karoo
to UPenn varies, but peaks around 40 Mbps.  The QA system will drive internet data transfer, but
NAS devices and RAID storage, transferred by air-freight shipping, will ensure full data transfer to UPenn.

%ii. transport to data centers
%In order to transfer maximally-compressed data over the internet in a timely manner, a network speed of around the instantaneous compressed data rate is required.  Negotiations with the IT SKASA and the South African internet provider (Tenet) have achieved transfer speeds between the PAPER site and the United States have been measured to be up to 40 Mbps, which easily
%accommodates the first two seasons of HERA observations.  In all seasons, however, portable, inexpensive, network-attached storage devices will be used to transfer data by air-freight shipping. 

%iii. data centers: access?

%The main data center at Penn will house all of the maximally compressed data from all seasons of HERA, as well as the LST-averaged data.  The storage system is sized so that there is a factor of 4 overhead for work on the maximally-compressed data set, and a factor of 2 on the LST-averaged. The 500 TB data storage will be coupled to a 32-node cluster which performs the tasks of calibration and averaging to further reduce the data volume.  This cluster will support the bulk of the analysis requiring the full data set.  Subsets will be served off to collaborators from this system.  The entire data storage and transfer plan for HERA draws heavily on the experience with PAPER data.

\subsubsection{Monitor and Control}
\label{sec:monitor}

The U. of Washington team leads the development of HERA's Monitor and Control (M\&C) system,
which will be a straightforward port of a similar system used on the MWA \citep{tingay_et_al2013_trunc}.
This system is
responsible for tracking observing status, array startup and shutdown, and
monitoring of all active HERA systems. In the process, the M\&C system builds a sizeable database of 
metadata that is crucial for verifying system functionality, identifying hardware failures, and feeding
calibration and contextual information into data analysis pipelines.  

%XXX flesh out

%In addition to Monitor and Control subsystem, which aggregates routine checks that are run automatically as
%part of the data compression and transfer pipeline, there is a need for deeper analysis
%exploring the data for more subtle defects, as well as monitoring progress toward sensitivity goals.
%We have set aside time for students at each institution, rotating among institutions, and managed at MIT,
%for performing such data exercises.
%Combine this with information from monitor database to identify hardware and subsystem failures.
%Aggregate lists of systems requiring maintenance attention, which are then handled by system owners

%\subsection{Prototype Construction and Testing}
%\vspace{-6pt}
%
%One prototype of the antenna has been constructed near the Radio Astronomy Lab in California. 
%This prototype serves as an important first construction test-bed and is currently being used to do 
%initial network analyzer measurements (Fig. \ref{fig:heracles}).
%This proposal calls for the construction of two additional prototype dishes alongside
%the PAPER array deployed at the NRAO site near Green Bank, WV.
%These dishes will be tested
%with a network analyzer in situ, and will be cross-correlated with PAPER elements using
%the correlator currently deployed on site, in order to measure
%the element performance and optimize the design.  The goal of this effort is to ensure
%that all signal reflections
%are attenuated by a factor of -60 dB by the time that they are capable of entering the signal path
%at a delays greater than 50 ns.  While signal reflections will be inevitable with such a dish
%design, the quality of the impedance match at the feed,
%the presence of structures that reduces resonances between
%the feed and the dish, and control of the focal height of the parabola are all aspects
%of the design that can
%be manipulated to help achieve this specification, ensuring that reionization modes above
%$k_\parallel=0.1h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ are not dominated by foreground contamination.
%
%
%These additional prototypes will be important to finalize the specific construction techniques to be 
%used in the final antenna construction contract in South Africa.

\vspace{-0.25in}
\subsection{Array Construction and Commissioning}
\vspace{-6pt}

Construction of HERA elements in the array consists of five primary steps: 
(1) site preparation and surveying, (2) pole installation by contracted labor with specialized utility pole equipment,
(3) hub placement and height adjustment, (4) construction of full element using local labor,
and (5) migration of PAPER dipoles to new ground screens by project staff.
Contractors and immediate supervisors will be based in South Africa.  Supervision staff 
will be part of the extensive support infrastructure in place on site associated with South African SKA activities.
%As mentioned above, the tall poles are shared amongst the antennas in the tight configuration.  
%These are standard telephone/power 
%utility poles and a great deal of  expertise and infrastructure exists to install these in remote settings.  
%Figure \ref{fig:hera_dish} (right) shows hexagonal antenna configuration, including the tall pole locations.
%The right panel shows a cross-section of an element.
The PVC and wood sub-assemblies 
are constructed under contract off-site where material and labor are readily accessible.  After being and shipped to site, the
remaining construction involving sub-assemblies, pre-cut wood, PVC, and pre-cut wire cloth 
is done on-site under contract.

%\end{figure}
%Except for two custom metal assemblies, the remainder of the construction materials are standard wood, 
%metal and PVC parts.  The two custom assemblies are simple small welded metal assemblies for the end of 
%rim support pieces (quantity 12) and the feed and feed backplane (quantity 1).  

%\subsection{Commissioning}

As construction proceeds incrementally, project staff will begin migrating over existing PAPER feeds and cables 
and start commissioning the array.  
Commissioning activities are led first by subsystem owners, verifying that deployed subsystems 
continue to pass the test suites developed for the Critical Design Review.
As the focus moves to system-level integration processes, downstream subsystems increasingly
lead commissioning efforts until a subset of the full HERA
array has been fully integrated and tested.  Once a baseline of functionality is established,
more antennas and upgraded subsystems can be incorporated incrementally as they are available.
These commissioning activities follow the highly successful
build/commission model used by both PAPER and MWA, % The PAPER team has
%commissioned 7 unique arrays, each with different correlators and
%configurations while the MWA, a much larger system designed for many
%operational modes, was successfully commissioned on schedule during a single
%coordinated effort.  
where observers tracked the incremental build-out
process, performed observations in a ``science-like mode,'' and made
adjustments as needed. The resulting modifications during this period resulted
in dramatically improved instrument performance.  

More advanced commisioning tasks involve all institutions, and
focus on meeting top-level science requirements
and resulting specifications.  %The most important of these are maximizing
%up-time, decreasing time-to-science, and optimizing for reionization science.
These tasks will exercise the Monitor and Control subsystem (M\&C; \S\ref{sec:monitor})
and the Quality Assurance data processor (QA; \S\ref{sec:data}), 
aggregatng sources of
information about array health from all subsystems and providing an accurate
state of the system report visible and understandable to the entire project.
Tests and pipelines developed during commissioning will be folded into
the routine analysis that reports to the M\&C system.  As systems stabilize,
useful post-processing steps such as redundancy-based calibration and automated
imaging will be incorporated into the on-site QA server.
%that is specifically for this purpose.

%Optimization for reionization science is achieved by making and reducing early
%science observations. This process includes many critical projects, such
%complex gain calibration (using redundancy and sky models), mapping of the beam
%pattern by comparison with PAPER elements and catalogs, establishing an
%absolute calibration, making images, cataloging visible sources. Crucially, it
%includes measuring signal reflections, cross-couplings and other possible
%artifacts using power spectrum analysis techniques. The end result will be an
%ongoing program of online deep integrations that will provide a near-real-time
%high-sensitivity delay spectrum verifying the absence of low-level reflections
%in the reionization window.

\subsection{Software, Analysis, and Science}
\label{sec:analysis}

Beyond the construction and data-taking aspects of HERA, this proposal incorporates a full data analysis effort, culminating in the publication of a suite of science papers connecting observations to the physics of cosmic dawn.

\compress
\subsubsection{Calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}

Building off the success of PAPER and MITEoR in such efforts, we will implement a real-time redundancy-based calibration pipeline.  The instantaneous calibration solutions provided by this pipeline allows one to quickly identify hardware misbehaviors, in addition to producing coarse real-time images.  The absolute calibration of these images will be fixed using a combination of self-calibration techniques and absolute-calibration baluns.  Increasingly detailed imaging efforts will then allow the development of empirical beam models (based on both sky models and octocopter signals) to complement electromagnetic simulations.  This is particularly important for characterizing the polarization response, which may affect estimates of polarization leakage.
%JCP: affect estimates? or correct for the effects of?

Second, once data quality is assured, multi-day periods of data may be
binned in local sidereal time, and averaged. This intermediate
averaging scheme will also generate an accurate visibility-based sky
model for the instrument once calibration is applied.

\compress
\subsubsection{Foreground Modeling and Removal}
\label{sec:DataProducts}

A high dynamic range imaging pipeline based on the Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD; \citealt{sullivan_et_al2012}) pipeline of the MWA will be adapted for HERA.  The result will be sky maps with full Stokes information that can be used not only for better foreground suppression, but also as an interesting data product in itself.  We plan to perform detailed studies of the polarized sky, such as characterizing the distribution of rotation measures.  Updates to source catalogs and the Global Sky Model \citep{deoliveira2008} will provide reference sky models for both HERA and other low-frequency instruments. The goal will be to generate a model suitable for direct subtraction of foregrounds. 

% XXX need more data products here

\compress
\subsubsection{Power spectrum and related measurements}

In early power spectrum measurements, we will employ the conservative delay-spectrum approach to power spectrum estimation used in PAPER.  This visibility-based approach, when coupled with a foreground-avoidance strategy, will be sufficient for an unambiguous early detection of the $21~\textrm{cm}$ power spectrum should results from current-generation experiments prove marginal (Fig. \ref{fig:eor_pspec} and Table \ref{tab:signif}).  Further development plans will target the incorporation of optimal quadratic estimators \citep{liu_tegmark2011,dillon_et_al2013a} in both visibility and image spaces, incorporating a fully covariant description of the foreground wedge.  This will enable statistical foreground mitigation techniques in addition to those based on foreground modeling (for example, from FHD).  Finally, we plan to explore Bayesian techniques for power spectrum estimation, building on the considerable progress already made on Gibbs-sampling imaging for interferometers \cite{sutter_et_al2014}.  Any 
techniques developed should be equally applicable to measurements in both the reionization epoch and the Dark Ages.

To provide verification of our power spectrum constraints, we also plan to develop an end-to-end simulator of the full HERA instrument, incorporating foregrounds and reionization models to output visibilities.

\compress
\subsubsection{HI Imaging}
Deep images will be summed to map HI emission (as described by \S\ref{sec:imaging_HI}) during reionization.   Foreground removal will follow the same basic plan as the power spectrum strategy.  Initially, residual images will be generated using the same conservatively foreground filtered and averaged data as input to an imager (e.g. FHD).  A subsequent, more sensitive method will use the image domain residuals generated by subtracting a foreground model.  Work on this method parallels the development of the precision foreground imaging and removal.

Sensitivity and significance of the images will be estimated by further developing the simulations shown in Figure \ref{fig:imaging}.

\section{Broader Impacts} % 1 page
% Aguirre

% XXX The Broader Impacts need to be better developed.

The HERA program will produce broader impacts in a range of areas.  At the core of our effort is a concerted international scientific collaboration and student exchange program with South Africa.  In addition, we will continue the PAPER and MWA legacy of training new scientists and engineers at the graduate, undergraduate levels, postdoctoral levels.  We will make major data products available publicly as a benefit to the community and will help to define the science context and techniques for the next generation of experiments, particularly the SKA.

\compress
\subsection{South African Student Exchange}

We propose to broaden the scientific and technical impact of HERA by a program of student exchange between HERA and South African scientific collaborators.  We have identified several collaborators at SA institutions (see attached letters of support from G. Bernardi (SKA-SA); C. Chiang, K. Moodley, and J. Sievers (UKZN)).  This exchange is intended to be a mutually beneficial experience, with students on both sides being prepared to be world leaders in astronomy, and particularly in future work with next-generation 21 cm reionization experiments, and with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).  This exchange will increase size, diversity, and quality of US graduate programs by engaging and preparing South African students for admission to US institutions, and exposing US students to the burgeoning radio astronomy facilities being developed in South Africa as part of the SKA. Both scientific and engineering exchanges will be part of this program.  

SKA-SA has been consciously and actively prioritizing support to previously disadvantaged South Africans.  A deliberate focus is on addressing gender and race inequality in science and engineering at all levels, by prioritizing support to black and women South Africans at undergraduate level, identifying non-traditional students, and guiding and supporting them into higher levels of research.  We will draw from this existing pool of talent.  
%The level of financial support provided by SKA-SA at all levels of study and research ensure that the students do not have to concern themselves with finding employment immediately after graduating from a degree, a problem faced by many students who have obligations to contribute to their families’ income.
Experience has shown that students benefit tremendously from peer mentoring and a sense of community, particularly when operating in a new cultural environment.  This is similar to the approach taken for South African students in their National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP)
%; http://www.star.ac.za/) 
and also in US programs (e.g., the Posse Foundation).
%http://www.possefoundation.org/).  
Our student exchange program would pay special attention to bridging issues of scientific culture, allowing both groups to function at the highest possible level within their exchange community.  We anticipate that this program will prepare students on both sides to be able to productively apply for graduate, postdoctoral, and faculty positions in the exchange country, and to effectively apply for observing time on the SKA and NRAO facilities.  

Specifically, we propose that each year of the grant, an exchange would be organized around a group of students (3 - 4) from each of the USA and RSA who would travel to a specific exchange institution to work on a related set of research problems over the course of a 3 month period (e.g., the northern summer).  These students would interact with both the host institution's faculty and also the postdoctoral and graduate researchers there.  Budget allowance is made for the students' travel, lodging and meals.  For students in a Master’s program, this might represent their only exchange, and they would be mentored on application into PhD programs or engineering positions.  PhD candidates would participate in multiple exchanges, with the goal of establishing a sufficient scientific presence in their host country to apply to build post-graduate collaborations, apply for postdoctoral or permanent positions, and be in an excellent position to make good use of the host country's radio astronomy facilities.  In order to vary the experience, each year would have a different host institution on each side, subject to the availability of mentors.  This exchange program builds on the existing collaboration between PAPER and South African scientists, and particularly upon the CASPER center founded at Berkeley.

%\subsection{Student Education}
%proposals must include, and will be evaluated on, a substantial component of
%student training and involvement of a diverse and inclusive workforce in
%instrumentation, facility development, or data management/analysis.

An essential element of the operational philosophy of PAPER and MWA has been the inclusion of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in all phases of design, construction, and analysis.  The combined efforts of these groups have trained an impressive cadre of scientists skilled in instrumentation, data analysis, and theory, as well as engineers working at the forefront of digital technology.

CASPER, founded at UCB, has been at the core of the digital development effort for PAPER.  It involves undergraduate, RAL interns, grad students, and postdocs, working alongside seasoned veteran engineers in a laboratory setting.  CASPER has been a powerful recruiting tool, bringing students to work from South Africa (Manley), and beginning the career of the PI, Parsons, as well as current graduate students (Ali, Zheng).  
%Recruiting of engineering students into science.
%Focus on both development, testing, and documentation phases of instrument development.  
%Involvement in design reviews.
%Harnessing energy of young students, combining with the stability and discipline.
CASPER has, via mail-lists, visiting students, and workshops, disseminated engineering expertise to a community broader even than the set of students and engineers supported under this proposal.
%Annual workshops.
%Hosting visiting students (reference next section). Cite past cases: Manley, Landon, Zhang (Omniscope).
%Mention specific success cases in progressing careers of instrumentalists: Parsons, Siemion, Ali, Hsyu, Leung, etc.
Although a critical core of instrument development and construction for HERA takes place at UC Berkeley, where it may be tightly integrated and managed, each institution contributes necessary instrumentation, computing, monitor/control, data management, and analysis software to the project.  For these subsystems, students and postdocs take a leading role in development and testing, with required participation in critical design reviews.  Students at all institutions are involved in deployment, commissioning, and observing.

%Plans for incorporating outreach and education tours of SA universities as part of regular site visits.

A commitment to undergraduate education and public outreach extends throughout the collaboration.  For example, MITEoR has trained seven physics undergrads (all of those that graduated have gone on to grad school in physics and astronomy), 
%2) We made our correlator design public to CASPER community;
and involved many grad students, postdocs, and visiting professors outside the field in the instrument construction.  PAPER has an admirable history of enlisting interns from South African universities as 
part of major engineering deployments, with the work applied as practical training 
within their academic program.  Furlanetto (UCLA)
%at UCLA 
has led two summer REU projects, and has
% This project [same one listed above] supported Dixon during part of her PhD thesis work and Mesinger during his first postdoctoral fellowship. It also led to two summer REU projects (though no support was required from the grant, thanks to the UCLA REU program) for Samuel Johnson Stoever (then at Cornell) and Fred Davies (then at New Mexico Tech, now one of the PI's graduate students).  Furlanetto also 
presented his work to three astronomy clubs in the LA area and at more than a dozen astronomy and physics colloquia and invited talks.   Aguirre (Penn) has had numerous undergraduate and high school students work on PAPER data, including one high-schooler who won the Acorda Scientific Excellence Award (ASEA) for his science fair project. He also developed a radio astronomy section for the Penn Experimental Physics Academy.
Parsons' CAREER grant supports pedagogical videos (via YouTube) and other resources, integrated with relevant research topics.

%{\it We have and will provide benefits to the astronomical community}

The collaborators in HERA also have a strong record of sharing both technological and data analysis innovation with the wider community through open source software (AIPY, DexM), the CASPER hardware and firmware (including MITEoR), and the publication of innovative data analysis approaches (FHD, MOFF, Omniscope).  While HERA is an experiment rather than an observatory, its results will be both scientifically relevant for setting the science context for SKA, JWST, and ALMA high-redshift observation.  
%Our benefit to the wider community is: 1. answering important question that is relevant to broader community studying first galaxies, 2. set science context for SKA, 3. develop techniques for SKA
% Cite high rate of adoption of CASPER hardware in the community.
% Delivering a next generation of signal processing platform.
% Development of heterogeneous computing systems involving CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, including DSP libraries, data handling, and control software.
% Sharing of LEDA GPU code \citep{clark_et_al2011} with PAPER's FPGA processors, data handling, and control software.
% Continued support and development for the benefit of the radio astronomy instrumentation community.
Additionally, data products from HERA will be made available to the wider community, which may be used for a variety of studies, both those directly relevant to cosmic dawn, and other topics, such as transient studies.  The Data Management Plan provides more details.

A number of derived data products will also be made accessible.  Source catalogs will be provided, and a Global Sky Model of diffuse foregrounds will be updated with new observations and released.  Foreground-subtracted data cubes of high-redshift $21\,\textrm{cm}$ intensity maps and the associated ionization field will be available for cross-correlation studies, as well as to provide context for high 
% redshift optical and IR studies.

%On the HERA timescale, a number of new observations will come online that would benefit from cross-comparison with the power spectra and images produced by HERA (see Section \ref{sec:CrossCorrelation}). For example, HERA will provide the large-scale reionization environment for pointed JWST or ALMA galaxy observations and can offer cross-correlations with  the WFIRST near-IR surveys \citep{lidz_et_al2009}.

%This HERA proposal follows the vision for 21~cm observations laid out in NWNH.
%PAPER and the MWA have already succeeded in the primary task envisioned in
%NWNH---characterizing the astrophysical foregrounds and developing the hardware
%and analysis tools needed to suppress the contamination. The discovery and
%characterization of the EoR Window and the development of precision foreground
%mitigation techniques have shown that foregrounds can be suppressed to the current
%thermal noise level (\S \ref{sec:Lessons}; \citealt{parsons_et_al2013}). While the MWA,
%PAPER, and LOFAR are pushing hard to detect the EoR power spectrum,
%a marginal detection is the best these instruments are likely to achieve.
%HERA will both ensure a high significance detection of the \HI 21~cm  signal as
%well as provide powerful constraints on the rise and fall of reionization \citep{pober_et_al2014}, how
%early stars and structure formed, and which physical processes dominated heating at the end of the
%cosmic dark ages (Figs. \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z} \& \ref{fig:eor_pspec}).
%
%As envisioned in NWNH, the US EoR projects (PAPER, MWA, EDGES, MITEoR) have
%pooled their expertise to develop the second generation HERA experiment. This
%has created a collaborative team with a deep well of scientific
%experience---the majority of papers on EoR observations are authored by members
%of the HERA team. By leveraging this expertise, the HERA design is significantly
%less expensive than envisioned in 
%NWNH and has greater scientific reach.
%
%The last few years have been remarkably productive---we
%understand foreground systematics and are pushing existing
%instruments to their thermal limits. We are now ready to build the HERA
%instrument envisioned in NWNH and realize the scientific promise of 21~cm
%cosmology. Studying the formation of the first luminous structures 
%and how they reionize the Universe is a primary driver for 
%nearly all major astronomical facilities over the next decade.
%Such studies include direct  observations of stars, gas, dust, and AGN in the
%first galaxies using the JWST, TMT, and ALMA. HERA is 
%a necessary element in this panchromatic arsenal, 
%providing a unique window onto the impact of these sources on 
%their large-scale environments.

This HERA proposal follows the vision for 21~cm observations laid out in NWNH, with the US EoR
projects (PAPER, MWA, EDGES, MITEoR) pooling their expertise to develop a second-generation
instrument.  The resulting team comes with a deep well of scientific experience --- the majority of papers on EoR observations are written by the HERA team.
%JCP: is this true?  certainly US papers on EoR observations... but counting GMRT & LOFAR, I wager not.
This expertise has led to rapid progress in the last few years, with current instruments having fulfilled their primary goal envisioned in NWNH: characterizing and suppressing astrophysical foregrounds through hardware and analysis development, to the point where thermal noise limits have been reached.  MWA, PAPER, and LOFAR are now pushing hard to detect the EoR power spectrum, but at best, the detection will be marginal.  Through judicious leveraging of the EoR window and related foreground mitigation techniques, HERA will not only ensure a high significance detection of the \HI 21~cm signal, but will also provide strong constraints on the reionization history \citep{pober_et_al2014}, early structure formation, and heating processes at the end of the
cosmic dark ages (Figs. \ref{fig:x_i_vs_z} \& \ref{fig:eor_pspec}).

With the lessons learned from current-generation instruments, we are now ready to build the HERA
instrument envisioned in NWNH and to realize the scientific promise of 21~cm
cosmology. Studying the formation of the first luminous structures 
and how they reionize the Universe is a primary driver for 
nearly all major astronomical facilities over the next decade.
Such studies include direct  observations of stars, gas, dust, and AGN in the
first galaxies using the JWST, TMT, and ALMA. HERA is 
a necessary element in this panchromatic arsenal, 
providing a unique window onto the impact of these sources on 
their large-scale environments.
