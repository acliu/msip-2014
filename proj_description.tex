The period beginning with the the birth of the first stars, and culminating with the full
ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) some 500 Myrs later, 
represents one of the last unexplored phases of cosmic evolution. During the Dark Ages
($z\simgt15$) and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim$15--6), a wealth
of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena are at work. The precise
properties of the IGM depend on the cosmic density field, the nature
and distribution of the first luminous sources (eg. typical masses, UV
escape fractions, biased structure formation), the efficiency and
abundance of heating sources (eg. X-ray binaries, shocks, or even dark
matter annihilations), the formation of the first supermassive black
holes, and the relative velocity of baryonic matter and dark-matter
halos, among other effects.  Exploring these early structures and
their effects on each other and their environments was one of the top
three ``{\it priority science objectives chosen by the [NWNH] survey
committee for the decade 2012-2021.}"

To date, a number of indirect probes have been used to understand
cosmic reionization. These include observations of resonant scattering
of Ly$\alpha$ by the neutral IGM toward distant quasars (the
'Gunn-Peterson' effect) \citep{fan_et_al2006}, kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich anisotropies in the CMB temperature
\citep{zahn_et_al2012_trunc}, the CMB \citep{planck_et_al2013} and its
polarization \citep{page_et_al2007}, and the demographics of
Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies \citep{treu_et_al2013}, as summarized in
the left-hand panel of Figure~\ref{fig:x_i_Xray}. The latest analysis
of these constraints suggests that the IGM may have been substantially
neutral even at $z \sim 7$ to 8 (as high as $F_{HI} \sim 0.5$), with
a tail of finite ionization ($\sim 0.1$) extending to high redshift
($z \sim 15$), driven by very early galaxy formation (Robertson et
al. 2013).  Unfortunately, these important results have limited
reach: the Gunn-Peterson effect and related phenomena saturate at low
neutral fractions, and the CMB provides only an integral measure of
the Thomson optical depth of the IGM back to recombination. Moreover,
many of these indirect observations are in tension with one another,
underscoring both the difficulty in their interpretation and the
complexity of the reionization process.

The 21-cm emission line from neutal Hydrogen has been recognized as
potentially the most powerful probe of cosmic reionization and 
the dark ages \citep{morales_wyithe2010,
furlanetto_et_al2006}, as emphasized in NWNH: ``{\it The panel
concluded that to explore the discovery area of the epoch of
reionization, it is most important to develop new capabilities to
observe redshifted 21-cm \HI emission, building on the legacy of
current projects and increasing sensitivity and spatial resolution to
characterize the topology of the gas at reionization.}"  The HI 21cm
line provides a direct method to image the evolution of the primordial
IGM, opening a unique window into the complex astrophysical
interplay between the first luminous structures and their
surroundings. Given that the signal is a spectral line, the HI 21cm
studies result in a full three-dimensional view of the evolution of
large scale structure during this 'last frontier' in observational
cosmology. The direct observation of the primordial IGM via
the HI 21cm line would be an achievement comparable in importance to
the detection of anisotropies in the CMB.

In the past decades, considerable effort has gone into modeling the
complex astrophysics of reionization
(e.g. \citealt{shapiro_giroux1987, haiman_loeb1997,
furlanetto_et_al2004, santos_et_al2010}). Figure ?? shows a simulation
of the expected evolution of the HI 21cm signal during
reionization. The HI 21cm fluctuations initially rise above those
expected from the Cosmic density field due to the growth of ionized
bubbles on a characteristic scale of a few to 10arcmin. This scale is
set by the clustering of early galaxy formation, as well as by
propagation effects through the IGM. The signal then declines as the
IGM becomes fully ionized.  The typical surface brightness for the HI
21cm emission is a few to 10 mK.  Imaging the evolution of these
typical structures requires the full collecting area of the
SKA. However, precusor experiments, such as PAPER and the MWA, are
underway which are designed to make the first statistical discovery of
this signal through power spectral and related analyses.

We emphasize that basic constraints on theoretical models are still
rudimentary, and the most fundamental questions concerning the process
of reionization remain open.  When did reionization occur, and over
what timescale?  What objects dominated the radiation field?  How were
the objects distributed?  What were the most important feedback
mechanisms in the transition from the first stars to first galaxies,
and how did they affect these populations?  {\it HERA provides the key
measurements that are needed to advance our understanding of early
galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.}

}\label{fig:Xray} \end{figure}

With high thermal noise sensitivity throughout the observing band, HERA represents an opportunity to push the redshift frontier of current-generation instruments, extending observations to the pre-reionization era in an uninterrupted way.  Doing so will allow a measurement of an earlier peak in the $21\,\textrm{cm}$ power spectrum, corresponding to an era of IGM heating from various X-ray sources.  Theoretical expectations span a wide range of possible scenarios for IGM heating, and Figure \ref{fig:Xray} shows several that were examined in \cite{mesinger_et_al2013}, with HERA's sensitivity overlaid.  It is clear that HERA possesses the sensitivity to easily detect and distinguish between these possibilities, placing the first observational constraints on the pre-reionization epoch, including possible bounds on exotic physics such as dark matter annihilation.

%iv. LOFAR/MWA/PAPER 
% Carilli
Three reionization path-finder array experiments are currently
operational: LOFAR, MWA and PAPER. All three are designed to have the
sensitivity to make the first statistical detection of the neutral
IGM. However, the HI line experiment is very challenging due to
foreground continuum emission some four orders of magnitude brighter
than the expected line signal.  The three experiments offer very
significant complementarity, with different intrinsic systematics and
different approaches to foreground mitigation. We emphasize that, for
such an important discovery, multiple approaches are critical in order
to check and verify any claimed (likely low S/N) detection amidst the
substantial systematic uncertainties. The first detection of
the neutral IGM is not the end of reionization studies, just the 
beginning. Recall that some four decades separated the first detection
of the CMB from the first statistical characterization.
