{\it For the Mid-Scale Science Projects category of the Mid-Scale
Innovations Program}

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) roadmap is a staged
program that uses the unique properties of the 21-cm line from neutral
hydrogen to probe the Epoch of Reionization and the preceding Dark
Ages.  During these epochs, roughly 0.3--1~Gyr after the Big Bang, the
first stars and black holes warm and reionize the neutral
intergalactic medium (IGM) that pervades the Universe following cosmic
recombination. Direct observation of the large scale structure of
reionization and its evolution with time, via the \HI 21-cm line, will
have a profound impact on our understanding of the birth of the first
galaxies and black holes, their influence on the intergalactic medium
(IGM), and cosmology.  CMB comparison statement? 

HERA was ranked the ``{\it top priority in the Radio, Millimeter, and
Sub-millimeter category of recommended new facilities for mid-scale
funding}" as part of the {\it New Worlds, New Horizons of Astronomy
and Astrophysics} decadal survey (\citealt{astro2010}; hereafter
NWNH).  The HERA roadmap initially envisioned a series of radio
interferometers constructed throughout the decade, starting with the
existing Donald C. Backer Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
instruments aimed at characterizing foregrounds and laying the
groundwork for a statistical detection of the HI 21cm signal through
the power spectrum.  A second-generation HERA instrument would measure
the evolution of the power spectrum in detail and reveal how early
structure in the Universe formed. A third-generation instrument would
image the typical structures during reionization.

While receiving only a fraction of the funding for HERA phase I
recommended in NWNH, the MWA and PAPER projects have made
major strides in understanding the techniques required to disentangle
the reionization signal from the strong radio continuum foreground
confusion. Based on this new understanding of array response to the
celestial signal, we are ready to build the next generation of HERA in
stages of 127 and 331 elements, observing in the 50--225-MHz band.
These stages increase the sensitivity by two orders of
magnitude over to the current arrays, through the use of an
optimal configuration of 14m diameter receptor elements, and a
tailored analysis technique that mitigates foreground contamination.
The proposed experiment delivers HERA-II science at a cost
substantially below originally envision in NWNH:

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\itemsep0pt

\item HERA~127 will measure the rise and fall of the EoR power
spectrum, constraining the timing and duration of reionization.

\item HERA~331 will measure EoR fluctuations over a variety of spatial
scales to determine the features and distribution of the first objects
that dominate cosmic reionization. HERA~331 will also extend precision
power-spectrum observations into the Dark Ages, and directly image the
largest scale structures in the IGM during reionization.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4pt}

The proposed program produces a sequence of dedicated experiments
optimized to fulfill the NWNH goal of characterizing the evolution of
the HI 21cm power spectrum during cosmic reionization. In
its final stages, HERA may be capable of imaging the neutral
IGM --- a task previously only considered for third-generation
instruments. This proposal includes funding for both the
telescope development and construction, as well as for the key
scientific data analyses for each stage of the project.

The {\it cosmic dawn}, or the period beginning with the the birth of the first stars and culminating with the full
ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) some 500 Myrs later, represents one of the last unexplored phases in 
the history of structure formation. During this period, a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena are at 
work. The characteristics of the IGM depend on (for example) the cosmic density field, the formation sites of the 
first luminous sources (e.g., their typical masses and clustering), their constituents (e.g., exotic Population III 
stars, more normal stars, stellar remnants, or supermassive black holes) their ultraviolet luminosities (which affect 
the IGM's ionization state), the efficiency and abundance of X-ray sources (which affect the IGM temperature), and 
even exotic effects like the relative velocity of baryons and dark matter.  Exploring these early structures and their 
effects on each other and their environments was one of the top three ``{\it priority science objectives chosen by 
the [NWNH] survey committee for the decade 2012-2021.}"

%SF: This next paragraph worries me a bit because most of these probes have one or several competing groups working 
%on them, and if we get a referee from one of the groups we don't reference they might get pissy...right now 
%I've tried to be fair but terse here
Observations are now just beginning to penetrate into this early epoch, primarily at its tail end.  Recent 
measurements from the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} have pinned down the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function 
at $z \la 8$ \citep{bouwens_et_al2010, schenker_et_al2013} and begun to detect a few sources at even greater 
distances \citep{ellis_et_al2013, oesch_et_al2013}.  Meanwhile, a number of indirect probes have placed constraints -- 
albeit model-dependent ones -- on cosmic reionization, as summarized in the left-hand panel of 
Figure~\ref{fig:x_i_Xray}. These include observations of resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ by the neutral IGM toward
distant quasars (the 'Gunn-Peterson' effect) \citep{fan_et_al2006}, the demographics of Ly$\alpha$ emitting 
galaxies \citep{schenker_et_al2012, treu_et_al2013}, and Ly$\alpha$ absorption near the most distant quasar 
\citep{bolton_et_al2011}, as well as measurements of CMB temperature fluctuations \citep{planck_et_al2013}, 
polarization anisotropies \citep{page_et_al2007}, and secondary temperature fluctuations generated by the 
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect \citep{zahn_et_al2012_trunc, mesinger_et_al2012}.  Reionization models can be 
built from galaxy observations.  Recent examples suggest that the IGM may have been substantially neutral even at 
$z \sim 7$--8 (as high as $F_{HI} \sim 0.5$), with a tail of finite ionization ($\sim 0.1$) extending to high 
redshift ($z \sim 15$), driven by very early galaxy formation \citep{robertson_2013}.  The extrapolation to 
$z>8$ is particularly uncertain, as only a handful of candidate galaxies have been found during that earlier 
era (c.f. \citealt{oesch_et_al2013}).  Unfortunately, these important methods have limited reach: strong assumptions 
are required about the stellar populations and escape fraction of UV photons from the galaxies, while astrophysical 
constraints on reionization are highly model-dependent and the CMB provides only an integral measure of the process. 
Moreover, many of these indirect observations are in tension with one another, underscoring both the difficulty in 
their interpretation and the complexity of the reionization process.

The 21-cm ``spin-flip" transition of  neutral hydrogen has been recognized as potentially the most powerful probe 
of cosmic reionization and  the dark ages \citep{morales_wyithe2010, furlanetto_et_al2006}, as emphasized in NWNH: 
``{\it 
%SF: Is this quote from the RMS panel?  If so, does it appear in the final report?
The panel concluded that  to explore the discovery area of the epoch of reionization, it is most important to 
develop new capabilities to observe redshifted 21-cm \HI emission, building on the legacy of current projects and 
increasing sensitivity and spatial resolution to characterize the topology of the gas at reionization.}"  Because 
the Universe is almost entirely neutral before reionization, the HI 21-cm line provides a direct method to image 
the evolution of the primordial IGM, opening a unique window into the complex astrophysical interplay between the 
first luminous structures and their surroundings. Moreover, because of the cosmological redshift, we can associate 
the signal at each observed frequency with a particular emission time (or distance) and reconstruct a complete 
three-dimensional picture of the time evolution of large scale structure during this 'last frontier' in 
observational cosmology. 
%SF: Personally I feel like the following is an exaggeration that could rub some people the wrong way!
The direct observation of the primordial IGM via the HI 21-cm line would be an achievement comparable in importance 
to the detection of anisotropies in the CMB.

In the past decades, considerable effort has gone into modeling the complex astrophysics of reionization
(e.g. \citealt{shapiro_giroux1987, haiman_loeb1997, furlanetto_et_al2004, santos_et_al2010}). Figure ?? shows a 
simulation of the expected evolution of the HI 21cm signal during reionization. The HI 21-cm fluctuations initially 
rise above those expected from the cosmic density field due to the growth of ionized bubbles on a characteristic 
scale of a few to 10~arcmin. This scale is set by the clustering of early galaxy formation, as well as by 
propagation effects through the IGM. The signal then declines as the IGM becomes fully ionized.  These theoretical 
models of the reionization process are sophisticated and appear to be well-understood, {\it but they are not 
predictive tools.} Instead, they provide a mapping between the largely unknown galaxy populations and observables 
like the 21-cm transition. As such, the key questions about the cosmic dawn era remain poorly understood.  When 
did reionization occur, and over what timescale?  What objects dominated the radiation field?  How were the 
objects distributed?  What were the most important feedback mechanisms in the transition from the first stars to
first galaxies, and how did they affect these populations?  {\it HERA provides the key measurements that are needed 
to advance our understanding of early galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.}

\end{figure}

A season of observing with HERA-127 will yield high-significance constraints on the 21 cm power spectrum across a wide range of k modes and redshifts.  In Figure we show the $z=9$ power spectrum predicted by the publicly available 21cmFAST software \citep{mesinger_et_al2011}, along with $2\sigma$ HERA sensitivities.  Using the conservative delay-spectrum approach employed in Parsons et al. 2014, we find that HERA-127 can achieve a $> 10\sigma$ detection of fiducial power spectra over a broad range of redshifts.  The subsequent observing season with HERA-331 can increase this detection significance to over $25\sigma$ using the same methods.  With detailed foreground modeling, a more sophisticated power spectrum estimator could increase the size of the ``EoR window", the region of Fourier space with minimal foreground contamination. This would allow for an overall detection significance of up to $90\sigma$, along with access to lower $k$ modes and therefore qualitatively different physics.  Such a high sensitivity measurement would also allow one to go beyond constraining parameters, testing rather than assuming the underlying theoretical framework.

\subsubsection{Astrophysical parameters from the power spectrum}
\emph{iii. Various covariance analyses: constraints on different physical processes (Liu/Pober analysis). but
please -- keep this down to a couple of incisive figures and fiducial models. wall paper doesn't sell very well. }
% Liu, Pober, Dillon
The power spectrum measurements with HERA-331 are sensitive enough to place constraints on theoretical models that describe the reionization process.  To first order, the major features of the power spectrum (as simulated by 21cmFAST) can be parameterized by three terms: $\zeta$, the efficiency at which galaxies release ionizing photons into the IGM; $T_{\rm vir}$, the minimum virial temperature of halos that produce ionizing photons (a proxy for the minimum mass of the galaxies that drive reionization); and $R_{\rm mfp}$, the mean free path for ionizing photons traveling through the IGM, which is determined the prevalence of dense Lyman limit systems.  Current observations limit the value of these parameters to within an order-of-magnitude (or worse, in the case of $T_{\rm vir}$).  Figure \ref{fig:ErrorEllipses} shows the constraints on each of these parameters achievable with multi-redshift HERA-331 power spectrum observations.  We expect to constrain these parameters to better than 5\% with a conservative approach to foregrounds , and even better with explicit foreground modeling \citep{pober_et_al2014}.

\caption{Pairwise $2\sigma$ error ellipses for $T_{\rm vir}$, $\zeta$, and $R_\textrm{mfp}$, in each case divided by their fiducial values.  HERA-331 projections using existing foreground avoidance techniques are shown in red, while projections using more advanced foreground modeling techniques are shown in black.  The former represent $\sim 5\%$ constraints, while the latter represent $\sim 1\%$ constraints.\label{fig:ErrorEllipses}}

\subsubsection{Imaging HI}
iv. Imaging large scale structure: simulation (Fig) 
With a nearly completely sampled aperture over 300m across, HERA will have the collecting area of Arecibo but with 500x the survey speed it presents the opportunity for directly imaging reionization.  After 100 hours on a single field (achievable in 200 nights, or just over one season) HERA will reach a surface brightness sensitivity of 50 $\mu$Jy compared with typical brightness temperatures of EoR models which often peak above 400 $\mu$Jy.

In imaging, as in the measurement of the power spectrum, noise and foreground residual are comparable limiting factors. Using the foreground filtration methods developed for power spectrum estimation, we can remove foregrounds exactly as done for the power spectrum estimation --filter the ``wedge'' in power spectrum space-- before imaging.  This ``foreground avoidance'' scheme effectively limits the bandwidth (line of sight modes) over which the residuals can be imaged without signal loss.  In Figure \ref{fig:imaging} we demonstrate the sensitivity of imaging in this mode assuming a conservative 1MHz of effective bandwidth, 12 Mpc along the line of sight.  The brightest structures in the redshift 8 input simulation are detectable at the SNR$>10$ level.

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/Imaging/HERA_FoV.jpg}
\caption{The HERA stripe.  At 150MHz ($z=8.5$) the HERA field of view is 8\arcdeg.

Each night it will drift scan 2600 square degrees for a survey volume of 50 $Gpc^3$.  The stripe includes the GOODs south field, one of the best studied regions of sky. \label{fig:HERA_FoV}}
\end{figure}

With a resolution of 60Mpc and survey area of 1 Gpc$^2$ in a single field of view HERA images will probe structure on scales well beyond any deep, high redshift field contemplated. For comparison, note that the entire Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), where 40\% of all objects at $z > 6$ have been found, is only (30Mpc ) 15{\arcmin } across. Using deep HERA images it will be possible to make targeted observations of early galaxies known to be in the center of large scale bubbles, directly observe clouds responsible for Ly$\alpha$ absorption, and correlate large scale intensity surveys.

The GOODs field itself is located within the HERA stripe, just 3 degrees outside of the image shown here.

}\label{fig:Xray} \end{figure}

With high thermal noise sensitivity throughout the observing band, HERA represents an opportunity to push the redshift frontier of current-generation instruments, extending observations to the pre-reionization era in an uninterrupted way.  Doing so will allow a measurement of an earlier peak in the $21\,\textrm{cm}$ power spectrum, corresponding to an era of IGM heating from various X-ray sources.  Theoretical expectations span a wide range of possible scenarios for IGM heating, and Figure \ref{fig:Xray} shows several that were examined in \cite{mesinger_et_al2013}, with HERA's sensitivity overlaid.  It is clear that HERA possesses the sensitivity to easily detect and distinguish between these possibilities, placing the first observational constraints on the pre-reionization epoch, including possible bounds on exotic physics such as dark matter annihilation.

Three reionization path-finder array experiments are currently
operational: LOFAR, MWA and PAPER. All three are designed to have the
sensitivity to make the first statistical detection of the neutral
IGM. However, the HI line experiment is very challenging due to
foreground continuum emission some four orders of magnitude brighter
than the expected line signal.  The three experiments offer very
significant complementarity, with different intrinsic systematics and
different approaches to foreground mitigation. We emphasize that, for
such an important discovery, multiple approaches are critical in order
to check and verify any claimed (likely low S/N) detection amidst the
substantial systematic uncertainties. The first detection of
the neutral IGM is not the end of reionization studies, just the 
beginning. Recall that some four decades separated the first detection
of the CMB from the first statistical characterization.

In terms of hardware, HERA is a straightforward system.  The element
itself is a fixed zenith-pointing 14-meter segmented prime-focus paraboloid with a high screen
to minimize cross-talk between elements (which are spaced 14.3 meters on a
hexagonal grid.  Figure \ref{fig:configuration} shows the layout of the array.  The $f/D$ of
the paraboloid is 0.32, so that the focal length, $f$, is less than 5 meters to meet the 
standing wave specification at the delays of interest of more than 60 dB of attenuation at delays 
greater than 15 ns.

Figure \ref{fig:schematic} shows the schematic

Figure \ref{fig:beampattern} shows the beampattern

The active feed sends back the entire dual-polarization analog bandwidth on standard
coaxial cable to an aggregation point called a ``node'', which services 
about 15 antennas.  This cable length is kept short (35-m) to keep any standing
wave contamination outside of the delay-space of interest for power spectrum
measurements.  The node amplifies, filters, digitizes and transmits the signal data stream
back to the central processing location (the Karoo Array Processing Building - KAPB).

HERA leverages the technical heritage of PAPER, MWA and of CASPER\footnote{Collaboration for Astronomical
Signal Processing and Electronics Research, a Berkeley-initiated worldwide open source community that is
developing boards, firmware and software for the astronomical community} and incorporates a
phased implementation to mitigate against risk.  The system, technology and phased approach is discussed below
