\title{Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array: Characterizing Cosmic Dawn}

\section{Overview} % 1 page ~ project summary? 
% Parsons

A. We propose HERA: next step in reionization roadmap

B. Fulfill NWNH high-priority goals

C. New understanding/techniques => faster, better, cheaper

D. Brief summary of timeline: science along the way, major results before end-decade

\section{Science} total = 8 pages

\subsection{Introduction}    % 1 page + 1 fig = simulated Tb cube + PS evolution
% Furlanetto, Carilli

i.physical concepts: reionization and dark ages

ii. Current knowledge: various constrai	nts, 1st galaxy studies...

iii. Important role of 21cm studies highlighted in NWNH

a. Typical ideal sim results: T_B vs. z 'cube' and corresponding power spectrum evolution (Fig)

b. introduce some of the important parameters/processes explored: when? how?
bubble scale? sources? inside out? [much of this could be left for below?)

c. reemphasize that current knowledge is nil, yet demand is high

d. emphasize unique (only?) probe of dark ages

\subsection{HI reionization and dark ages science} % 4 pages total examples using hera 331, plus a number of figures

i. F(HI) vs. z: HERA vs. other techniques (Fig) -- emphasize constaints in unexplored territory
% Bowman

ii. PS sensitivity at fixed z: 127, 331 (Fig)
% Pober, Dillon

iii. Various covariance analyses: constraints on different physical processes (Liu/Pober analysis). but
please -- keep this down to a couple of incisive figures and fiducial models. wall paper doesn't sell very well. 
% Liu, Pober, Dillon

iv. Imaging large scale structure: simulation (Fig) 
% Jacobs
    
a) Imaging as a probe of non-Gaussianity and topology of reionization (Fig from Watkinson & Pritchard)
[Not sure if this belongs here, should discuss: b) Bayesian imaging (Figs from Paul Sutter).  
Perhaps a broader impact on the radio community too?]
% Morales, Tegmark

v. Approaching Dark ages (z=20 to 30): early Xray heating? other (Fig - Liu models)
% Liu, Dillon, Hewitt

vi. 21cm forest: perhaps a paragraph on possibilities of small scale structure, if we can find radio galaxy? (Fig) 
% Carilli, Furlanetto

vii. Cross-correlation science: perhaps montage Fig showing HI(Tb), galaxies, dark matter... at given epoch
% Aguirre, Tegmark

a. Provide environmental context for ALMA/JWST 1st galaxy studies

b. CMB pol 

c. CO/CII IM: optimistic or wrong timescale?
  
d. note: xcorr further mitigates continuum systematics

\subsection{Where we are right now: PAPER, MWA}  % 2 pages

i. describe arrays, state design driven by new understandings as delineated below (Fig)
% Parsons, Bowman

ii. Using new techniqes, current best limits  (Fig)
% Parsons, Morales

iii. what will happen in next 2 years: hopefully detection, but no more

iv. LOFAR: not sure what to say about lofar. but we could emphasize this is difficult measurement with 
profound astrophysical impact. such a situation demands multiple approaches, since initial 'discovery' is 
likely to be low S/N and strongly affected by systematics. multiple approaches are crucial check/verify. 
moreover, even if LOFAR beats MWA and PAPER to discovery, that will just be the start of reionization 
studies, not the end. HERA II is that next required step. 
% Carilli

iv. HERA II: 'gauranteed' detection, full characterization, dark ages, imaging
% Parsons

v. Move 'analysis' stuff here?


\section{Challenges} % 2 pages

\subsection{Foregrounds}  % 1.5pages
% Parsons, Morales

i. relative intensities (Fig: Continuum from MWA)

ii. Details on Delay Spectrum approach

a. key: 3D k-space: show wedge and discuss. chromatic sidelobes with characteristic freq scale 
set by baseline length

b. analysis focuses on line-of-sight PS dimension

c. work in EoR window.  different window levels, depending on effective horizon

d. drives design to redundant array: helps calibration, add spectra coherently

e. dictates geometry of antenna elements and other RF stuff. avoid standing waves of given length. 

f. area: drives sensitivity as used in section 2

g. some words about why compact, hex array 

\subsection{Other Challenges} % 0.5 pages

i. Interference: Karoo RFI plots  FIG 
% Jacobs

i. Polarization 
% Moore, Aguirre

D. Ionosphere: 

i. short baselines and narrowish FoV

ii. direction dependent gains?


\section{HERA design and project} % 8 pages

\subsection{Lessons learned recap} % 0.5 page
% Parsons, Morales

reemphasize design dictated by new understanding

\subsection{Project component details}  % 6 pages
% DeBoer to parse

i. compact hex grid array

ii. 14m elements + broad band (active) dipole feed

iii. Signal transport: RF to nodes, digitize at nodes. fiber to correlator. 

iv. Digital stuff: emphasize 'solved problem'. Casper work. block diagrams...

C. Post correlator data path

i. local storage

ii. transport to data centers

iii. data centers: access? 

D. Data analysis [Move up?]

i. Calibration 

ii. Continuum and removal

iii. Delay spectrum analysis

iv. Other (related) approaches: Bayes, z-variance,

v. HI imaging

E. Array monitoring/maintenance: daily, weekly health monitoring

F. Aspirations [move to facilities section?]

i. FFT correlator

ii. other

\subsection{Five year Schedule and deliverables} % 0.5 page
% De Boer

i. stages and science

ii. first science within 3 or 4 years

iii. main science results before end of decade


\section{Broader impacts} % 1 page
% Aguirre

A. pre and post-doctoral students

B. South Africa connection

i. professional development/exchanges

ii. broader outreach in SA

C. Broader astronomy community

i. Data access: transients, SETI, ionosphere

ii. Cross correlation: CMBpol, CO/CII IM

D. Casper open source: good example to build from


\section{VI. Summary: why us and why now?} % 0.5 pages
% Parsons

that's obvious
